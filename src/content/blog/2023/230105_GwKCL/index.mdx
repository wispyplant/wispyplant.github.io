Across the term, my work with the students included informal seminars introducing the concepts of climate justice in relation to colonial histories, resource scarcity and power, while practical workshops included sketchbooking moments, zinemaking, speed-sculpting and shaping a space for the students to collectively hone their ideas into artwork proposals and production, towards a final public exhibition 'Superbloom' at Bush House, on the Strand.

(January 5, 2023 → March 21, 2023) KCCC is the cultural programme engaging with climate change at King's College London, run by the university's extra-curricular programme King's Culture. 

Groundwater is the KCCC project running from Jan- end of March 2023. Across the term, my work with the students included informal seminars introducing the concepts of climate justice in relation to colonial histories, resource scarcity and power, while practical workshops included sketchbooking moments, zinemaking, speed-sculpting and shaping a space for the students to collectively hone their ideas into artwork proposals and production, towards a final public exhibition at Bush House, on the Strand. 

Students from any subject area at the university were invited to apply to be Groundwater Artists, workshopping with me and the other Lead Artist Beccy McCray to create a collective public artwork. Beccy and I each oversaw half the group (10 students), and my group chose the theme of Resource Scarcity and Power to develop our project. 

Our zine is based on the students' ongoing themes and I invited [em-dash studio](https://em-dash.studio/#) to workshop with the students to gather and show their work-in-progress during the production stage of their artworks."
