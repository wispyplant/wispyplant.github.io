(March 18, 2023 → March 19, 2023) After a term of activities introducing students to artistic methods for critical climate engagement, The Intensive Maker Weekend was dedicated 'studio time' to materialise their artistic visions they had been researching and drafting. Under the collective title of Resource Scarcity and Power, my ten students created several artworks (interactive installation, mixed media sculpture, video, painting). I also invited em-dash studio to workshop and co-create a zine with the students to gather their intertwined ideas through learning about  collaging, scanner art and zines as communication tools.

More about Groundwater: 

As part of KCL's newly launched Culture Climate Collective programme, a group of 20 students from different areas of study (non-art practice) participated in a Groundwater project.

King’s Culture Climate Collective supports students’ arts, creativity and storytelling as powerful forces for transforming our climate emergency. Created with and for King’s students, the Collective will feature collaborative arts projects alongside vibrant participatory events to enable you to build community, generate new visions and take action for a sustainable future.  

Groundwater is the first project for students to work as artists, guided through the climate arts programme by Guest Lead Artists myself (Angela YT Chan) and Becky McCray.
