Organised by Whitechapel Gallery and Gallery Climate Coalition, I gave an iteration of my workshop, Storytelling interconnectedness: Situating climate stories in the real and imaginary. Storytelling Interconnectedness prompts: what does it mean to upload speculative fictions as mapped data points? How can we geolocate the uncertainties we feel about our changing environments over time?

"Featuring voices from leading visual arts and environmental organisations as well as change-makers from beyond the sector, this two-day symposium tackles the critical environmental issues facing the UKâ€™s public arts institutions.  

Through a day of panel discussions and presentations, followed by a day of action-focused workshops, this event will provide context and clarity by pooling expertise and data to identify solutions, equipping participants with the knowledge and ambition to take effective action.  

 Following the event, participants will receive access to new resources expanding on the topics explored in the symposium, including a customisable Decarbonisation Action Plan for non-profit arts organisations."
