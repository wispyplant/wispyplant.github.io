(March 17, 2023 → June 8, 2023) By invitation of [Tim Harrison](https://www.welivehere.org.uk/contact), I provided insights into climate justice approaches for the Oerol cultural festival talks and workshops programme planning. 

"Oerol is a cultural festival on the island of Terschelling in the Netherlands that is held annually in June. The ten-day festival is focused on live, public theatre as well as music and visual arts."
