Speaking to an audience in architecture and spatial practices, my artist talk outlined my journey into a climate justice aligned art practice. I gave a presentation of current research areas, such as into the greenwashing in the UK defence sector and what this entails as a climate narrative against the long, colonial history of climate change. I also delivered an iteration of my digital mapping speculative climate stories workshop. 

Storytelling Interconnectedness is about situating climate stories in the real and imaginary: what does it mean to upload speculative fictions as mapped data points? How can we geolocate the uncertainties we feel about our changing environments over time?

"re:arc institute works at the intersection of climate action and architecture philanthropy, we fund community-led solutions that address the root causes and consequences of climate breakdown."
