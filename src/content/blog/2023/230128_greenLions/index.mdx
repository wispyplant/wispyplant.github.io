I gave an introductory talk to how arts practices can engage with climate change issues as an approach to create and sustain cross-border solidarities, offering examples of my artistic and curatorial project to illustrate the importance of collaboration. 

"Marking the end of our Winter Festival, Green Lunar New Year took a spin on traditional East and Southeast Asian celebrations, inviting all to seek more sustainable ways to live in response to the climate emergency. Working closely with community climate group the Green Lions, we programmed a full day featuring insightful talks, film screenings, a bustling makers market selling unique products by ESEA artisans, craft workshops, mahjong, and sold-out supper clubs."
