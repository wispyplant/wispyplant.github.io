(November 1, 2023 → January 26, 2024) Our forestscapes project has been included in an exhibition on Seeking Connection at the Bush House Arcade in London. The project explores soundscapes as a method for attending to forests as living cultural landscapes.                 

"Seeking Connection: Living Well with Technology is an exhibition presented by King’s Culture and the Digital Futures Institute that explores the different ways we could learn to live well with technology and navigate opportunities for meaningful connections with ourselves, our communities and our planet.

From the smallest cell to the vastness of the planet and beyond, the works on display in the Arcade are all examples of transformational research taking place across King’s that interrogate new and emerging technologies.

The exhibition is complemented by an exciting public talks and events programme designed to delve deeper into emerging digital technologies, including the challenges and opportunities that arise from them."
