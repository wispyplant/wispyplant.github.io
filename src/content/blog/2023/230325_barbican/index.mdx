My workshop for the Young Visual Arts Group for participants (aged 16-29) began with an introductory talk on the key ideas of climate justice and how colonial histories are connected. This led to the interactive workshop exercise that aimed to mindmap and create models of their own concerns and experiences around climate and social issues. Participants worked individually and in small groups, with a final show-and-tell at the end prompting a discussion moment for the young people to contemplate their feelings around global and local changes.
