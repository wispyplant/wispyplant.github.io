I participated in this workshop as part of Dani Admiss' curation that asks 'How do we Understand Diverse Cultural Contexts of Just Energy Transitions?', with this session considering energies in the broadest sense. 'Portalling between two or more worlds to be in communion with present, past and various diverse spaces and narratives, artist and arts therapist Farah Salem will run a series of communal therapy and healing exercises drawing on traditions and rituals from her homeland of the Arabian Peninsula. Dani Admiss and Megha Ralapati will bring us together to explore the links between our nervous systems, sustainable living and internal healing.'

In a reflection note to Farah afterwards, I wrote: 

I started drawing my visual notes on the fabric as rain and waterways. The water cycle - in all its various material and geographic states - is something I think about directly and metaphorically across my work. It flowed into moving my feelings towards the spaciousness of the earth's surface, something Farah's exercises encouraged us to tune into. I paid attention to the processes that change peoples and ecologies that alter the landscapes on the ground. Also, I thought about how the closer something is, the more tangible it can become. I reached into my connection to my research (ongoing climate histories and the military) and the collective efforts to shut the local arms factory down has been a meaningful part of my commitments lately. There's thought-mapping happening here that reiterates to me the reasons I choose to spend energies here.
