I was invited to join a workshop organised by Dr Hannah Lammin (University of Greenwich) for researchers to share concepts and methods of using fictional and visual approaches in the context of our practices, media studies and cultural theory, to then openly map the critical connections between both. 

"uncertain relations is a series of symposiums exploring emergent and foundational concepts in media studies and cultural theory. Each symposium sets two concepts in an uncertain relation, asking for critical reflection on the ambiguities that are generated between the specificity of two ideas. 
The series does not look for harmony but rather seeks the frictions that reconfigure the world and our understandings. uncertain relations is an exploration of the gaps, frictions and connections that are the basis of creative thought and critical practice.

During the workshop, presenters will share short position statements that articulate their perspective on the uncertain relations between fictioning | visual. These position statements will be approximately ten minutes in length and can take the form of traditional papers, pre-recorded presentations, performative lectures, video essays, or any other form the presenter chooses, and will be used as a starting point for a horizontal discussion between participants which will map critical connections between and around the two terms."

The project has been supported by The Centre for Spatial and Digital Ecologies as part of the Institute for Inclusive Communities and Environments at The University of Greenwich.
