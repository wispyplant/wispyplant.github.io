I gave a talk to the cohort of CTRL artists about climate justice beyond 'sustainability' in digital media art practices, highlighting the how we can think about using and presenting art with technologies in socially and environmentally more responsible ways. 


"A development programme for artists to learn skills in creative technology performance, immersive experience making, and digital creation tools. 

CTRL (Creative Technology Research Labs) is a 6-month pilot artist development programme co-produced by Submerge and The Lowry. Creative technology is the intersection of new technology and the creative industries; examples of artistic practice include technology enhanced performance, interactive installations and immersive experiences.

Through this programme Submerge and the Lowry are supporting 14 artists who are under-represented in the sector to learn from inspirational creative technology artists, gain new skills and knowledge, connect with local and national artists and organisations, and start to develop ideas for the creation of new creative technology performances and immersive experiences."
