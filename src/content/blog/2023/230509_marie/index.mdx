I spent some time with Marie Smith discussing her ideas with her as part of her research stage of her Digital Residency as an artist at Horniman, exploring the natural collections, grounds and history. 

"From April to September 2023, I was Digital Artist in residence at Horniman Museum and Gardens. During the six month I researched explored two theme - People and Worming. The section titled ‘People’ explored the cyanotypes made by the botanist Anna Atkins alongside meeting members of staff at Horniman who were able to illuminate on the collection and the gardens. 

The other section titled ‘Worming’ reflects my methodology whilst I undertook the residency. I ‘wormed’ through exterior and interior space of the Horniman. What I mean by ‘worming’, is I am utilising the skills of a worm to facilitate new paths of inquiry that will aerate elements of the Horniman that have yet to be explored. 

This blog reflects my research and how I worked through my concerns and concepts, mostly in the form of lens-based work such as analogue black and white photography alongside Super 8 analogue film. I also incorporated audio, which provided another medium for me to explore. The residency finished with two main outcomes, a book of cyanotypes that I made during my residency called Extraction: In conversation with Anna Atkins and an accompanying audio - visual piece. Elements of the audio have been transcribed."
