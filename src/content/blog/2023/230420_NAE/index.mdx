(April 20, 2023 → April 22, 2023) I was offered a bursary to attend the important Let's Talk Conference: Conversations examining the Global Ethnic Majority and the Cultural Sector, organised by CVAN EM and New Art Exchange. 

"Conversations about the Global Ethnic Majority within (or outside) the cultural sector aren’t happening enough. The Let’s Talk Conference will address the imbalance by exploring key topics through conversations with artists and communities. Panya Banjoko, Joon Lynn Goh and Lara Ratnaraja will lead conversations exploring the notion of space, connections, and the need for public discourse to be led by, with, and for the Global Ethnic Majority."
