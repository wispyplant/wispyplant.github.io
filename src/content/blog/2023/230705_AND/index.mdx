(July 5, 2023 → July 7, 2023) We spent our first residency Catalyst Lab based at Somerset House to explore the potentials of creative XR technology (with Ben Neal) towards our collective commission that will research and share Tatton's history for Tatton Park Biennial.

"From 5- 7 July 2023, our selected Impossible Perspectives artists participated in the first of two Catalyst Labs at Somerset House in London.

They met with industry experts including Creative Technologist Ben Neal from Psicon Lab, to develop the ideas they worked on together at Tatton Park in 2022."
