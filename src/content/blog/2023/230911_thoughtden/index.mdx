I brought some insights on climate change topics, working with young people and games to help shape the prototyping of Ben Templeton / thoughtden's card game 'CRACT!' The game encourages young players to use critical thinking, collaboration and creativity to build on their climate action activities.


"The Critical Action Lab is an emerging collaboration (currently in prototype mode) between science and natural history organisations in America to support teens taking action in their local communities. The game is a short multiplayer game about discussing and composing creative climate actions."
