During my first workshop with forestscapes, we listened to the collated sound files relating to forest issues. From researcher field recordings of sites experiencing deforestation, forest fires, reforestation, and more, we listened through sound artist Andrés Saenz de Sicilia and Zack Scholl's co-written scripts for Supercollider, an open source generative sound software (for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition). 

We collectively framed critical questions to begin approaching listening as a method for understanding this wide and complex issue of forest life in changing environments and times. 

"The forestscapes project is a collaboration between the Department of Digital Humanities, the Department of Geography and the Centre for Digital Culture at King’s College London, together with the Public Data Lab. It is supported by the National Environmental Research Council."
