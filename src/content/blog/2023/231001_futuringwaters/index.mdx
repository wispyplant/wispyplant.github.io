My essay reflects on my workshop series 'Storytelling Interconnectedness'(2022-2023) that explores speculative climate timelines through digital mapping. I delivered a workshop iteration for Futuring Waters by Jenny Marketou between 15th, 16th and 17th June 2023 as part of the [2023 Eleusis European Capital of Culture in Elefsina](https://2023eleusis.eu/en/events/mystirio-42-futuring-waters-2023-06-14/), Greece. 


"Futuring Waters ; A Speculative Manifesto from and for the Waters of Eleusina is the outcome of a creative journey made out of ideas, values and beliefs in times of systemic environmental destruction, monster storms, the destruction of every form of life, inequality and violence. It provides readers with extraordinary experiences to temporarily transcend the human/non-human divide and dive into a relationship of reciprocal belonging. The book foregrounds Marketou’s art practice in shaping collective awareness, preserving identity and environmental memory through arts, social activism and knowledge production as artistic strategies. It is also about the potential of art to have critical impact about the kinds of worlds we want to live in.

“Moving between the local environmental histories of Eleusis, Greece through the literal life of Aegean across the real and virtual landscapes water flows and ancestral mythologies this publication calls for new social and ecological possibilities centred on multi species cooperation. It asks what are the implications of recognising water as an active agent capable of authoring and defending its universal rights” – excerpt from the publication introduction by Ariana Kalliga, curator based in New York.

Jenny Marketou brings together voices by international eco art curators artists, philosophers, scientists, environmental activists, poets, architects, marine archeologists such Nikolas Anastasopoulos, Eva Andronicidou, Tatiana Theodoropoulou, Dimitra Ioannou, Ariana Kalliga, Evangelos Katsanevakis, Areti Miza, Eleni Riga, Dr. Michael I. Skoullos, Angela YT Chan, Denis Maksimov, Joulia Strauss, Blanca de la Torre and citizens of Eleusis.

The book is the outcome of Marketou’s durational art project Mystery 42, Futuring Waters which was commissioned by 2023, Eleusis European Capital of Culture.
