Programmed by New Contemporaries, the South London Gallery and MA Art & Ecology at Goldsmiths University in partnership with Camberwell College of Arts, I delivered an iteration of the Storytelling Interconnectedness Digital Storymapping Workshop. Storytelling Interconnectedness is about situating climate stories in the real and imaginary: what does it mean to upload speculative fictions as mapped data points? How can we geolocate the uncertainties we feel about our changing environments over time?

"New Contemporaries are delighted to be collaborating with Goldsmiths MA Art & Ecology, South London Gallery and Camberwell College of Arts on programming ‘Mystic Ecologies’ a symposium of discussions, workshops, performances and screenings.

The symposium will investigate how our interconnectedness with environmental ecologies can be rethought using alternative or reimagined futures and speculative or fantastical possibilities.  Discussions will reflect on how the impact and visibility of the environmental crisis might evolve potential for co-existence with the non-human. 

What can we learn from our botanical, geological and elemental counterparts to advance knowledge and envision new illusionary opportunities for sustainable and environmentally responsible survival?  Participants will bring experiences that go beyond the cautionary or responsive: not rejecting scientific or forensic approaches but considering illusionary, mythological and fantastical possibilities."
