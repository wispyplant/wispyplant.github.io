(September 6, 2023 → September 8, 2023) We spent our second residency Catalyst Lab based at FACT's [Studio/Lab](https://www.fact.co.uk/studio-lab), with a day revisiting Tatton Park, to explore the potentials of creative XR technology in our collective commission that will research and share Tatton's history for Tatton Park Biennial. 

"Impossible Perspectives Lab is a unique XR (extended realities) residential talent development programme for UK-based artists.

The programme is inspired by Tatton Park’s landscape, a large heritage attraction in Cheshire, and the works of Italian painter Canaletto, whose paintings and drawings form part of the property’s archive collection. Canaletto’s works are renowned for their immersive qualities of imaginary architectural views (referred to as capricci), creating ‘impossible perspectives’ considered to be fledgling versions of current virtual reality.

It will offer a supportive space for sharing, learning and expanding selected artists’ practices in scale and technologies of production, such as augmented, virtual, and mixed reality technologies (XR). The programme will support the artists to consider: How can new technologies of seeing allow us to question landscapes, histories and architecture in the present? How can augmented realities challenge and excite public experiences of collections? How can art change our perspectives on power, wealth and histories?"
