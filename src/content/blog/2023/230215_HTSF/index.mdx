"Published by Arcadia Missa, each issue of How To Sleep Faster centres loosely on a theme – previous examples include “No Future” and “Collapse”. This issue’s theme is “Empathetic Earth”. As concerns about the climate crisis grow in urgency like fungus growing on your bedroom wall, the journal invites contributors to speculate on empathy as a route out of this emergency."
