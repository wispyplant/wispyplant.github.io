Exploring tricky decision making scenarios for freelance art workers, such as negotiating fees, artistic vision and seeking aligned values with commission hosts, I created a digital narrative game for participatory discussion prompting as my panel contribution. 

"What lies in the intersections of ecology, art, and labour? And how can we embody these ideas as a means to move towards an Otherwise? Join Ama Josephine Budge, Angela YT Chan and Becky Lyon as they reckon with the stickiness of these questions and expose the guts and mechanics of how the arts currently operate. Homing in on specific threads from their practices, Ama, Angela and Becky will begin the event with a series of provocations, to set the tone and the sow seeds of their conversation. 

Using these provocations as a springboard, the trio will discuss how art and ecology relate to futurity and imagining ways of doing Otherwise, unraveling the possibilities these intersections hold. They will speak to how they each actively engage with reworking, resisting, transforming and critiquing the problematics of the arts sector through artmaking and interrogation, and the impact that navigating such a system has on personal practice and artistic value. Before closing with a reflection on how pleasure and the body converse with ecological practice and thinking. 

The panel will end with time for reflections and a Q&A where you can put all your burning questions to Ama, Angela, and Becky. "
