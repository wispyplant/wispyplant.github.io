For the 9 month peer-to-peer learning journey – addressing systemic challenges through life-sustaining neighbourhoods, health, nature, dignity, and justice – I gave a talk on my creative practice and what it means to be aligned to climate justice.

"Hosted in partnership between Centric Lab, CIVIC SQUARE and Centre For Alternative Technology, the purpose of this collective journey is to create the space and time for communities advocating for justice in their neighbourhoods to imagine, learn, and grow their own ecosystems, frameworks, and practices for healing through non-western epistemologies, data knowledges, and Kinship."
