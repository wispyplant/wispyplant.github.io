Rescheduled from a March 2023 event in the series, I gave a workshop for the full-day symposium titled 'Polyvocality'. Literary and Visual Landscapes (LVL) is an interdisciplinary seminar series at the University of Bristol, established in 2012 with a broad focus on research into space and place. 

"Narrating the climate crisis is multifaceted – we can describe our experiences in multiple time scales, through real and imaginary places, with multispecies actors, a spectrum of processes and a range of emotions. To think about how climate changes the land- and water-scapes around us, we look to cartography, specifically how maps are layered with information. But which layers connect to our experiences and how can we take the lead in authoring our new climate narratives to a real place?

In this workshop, we will explore how the breadth (processes on the earth’s surface) and depth (timelines) of our land- and waterscapes are impacted by climate change and the power structures that shape narratives. We will have prompted mind mapping activities through drawing, text-based and diagram making, and bring these together in our conversations. Our aim is to activate the ways we narrate the different strata of our climate landscapes, and create multimedia experiments that express our relations to them. "
