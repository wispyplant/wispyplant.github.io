I was commissioned to adapt my digital collage series and accompanying essay [‘States of Hydration’]() into a video essay and delivered a pre-recorded presentation for the Island to Island Symposium held at Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, University of East Anglia online and in Norwich. 


For the guest edit of UCHRI by Melody Jue and Maya Weeks ‘States of Hydration’ is my photo essay that is a part of the [Holding Sway: Seaweeds and the Politics of Form](https://uchri.org/awards/holding-sway-seaweeds-and-the-politics-of-form/) series, funded by UCHRI’s Recasting the Humanities: Foundry Guest Editorship grant.

"This symposium features several curators of recent and current exhibitions and programmes addressing these and related issues in various locations across Great Britain, and artists whose work engages with relevant themes. Through considering these diverse approaches we will reflect on past and present practices and look towards future directions." The event is part of a larger project Curating the Sea by Dr Pandora Syperek and Dr Sarah Wade.
