For this iteration of my workshop 'Storytelling Interconnectedness: Situating climate stories in the real and imaginary', I guided students to think directly about their current research interests. I facilitated a digital mapping activity to put the participants' lived experiences, climate histories and speculative stories as data in virtual and real landscapes, using the 'storymaps' towards protoyping their upcoming course projects. Storytelling Interconnectedness is about situating climate stories in the real and imaginary: what does it mean to upload speculative fictions as mapped data points? How can we geolocate the uncertainties we feel about our changing environments over time?

My workshop for the Co-Design for Sustainable Futures module was part of MA Design for Social Innovation and Sustainable Futures at London College of Communication, University of the Arts London.
