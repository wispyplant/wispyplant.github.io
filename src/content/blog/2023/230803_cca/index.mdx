I invited sci-fi and games researcher and former peer as a LSFRC co-director Avery Delany to share a conversation with me on the emancipatory capacity of digital storytelling and its problematic entwinement with capitalist structures. 

We discussed cyber cultures, games and social justice in the frame of technologies, specifically how digital technologies can play a role in relation to climate change while reshaping ancient narratives into digital realms. 
 
While we didn't touch on the CCA exhibition the talk was programmed as a part of, we more expansively questioned who is considered within cyber cultures, which bodies are centred, and how can digital environments be mobilised as spaces to reject entrenched social hierarchies and posit alternative futures?
