title: "Diorama DIY! Workshop with Dr Verity Burke for 'Speculative Space of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums' at the Science Museum, London"
description: "I co-delivered a workshop at the Science Museum with Dr Verity Burke about climate narratives, ecology and museum experiences through habitat dioramas. Our aim was to frame museum exhibition dioramas – historically framing colonial perspectives – as stimulating speculation or operating in speculative modes through decolonial tools. We intended for our artist and researcher participants to contemplate “What kind of landscape would climate change move you to journey into?”"

‘The Speculative Space of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums’ project is by Megen de Bruin-Molé, Amy Butt and Noriko Suzuki-Bosco, University of Reading. 

"‘The Speculative Space of Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums’ project will comprise a series of creative workshops that explore the critical ground that exists between science fiction (sf) and Gallery, Library, Archive and Museum (GLAM) spaces and collections. It will consider depictions of GLAM spaces in sf media, existing collections and exhibitions which contain sf media, and sf as a creative practice for engagement and critical reflection within GLAM spaces, looking to the imaginative futures and alternate presents of sf to critically reflect on the futures of these spaces and institutions."
