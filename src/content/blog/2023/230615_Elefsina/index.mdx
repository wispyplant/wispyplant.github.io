(June 15, 2023 → June 17, 2023) I led expanded iterations of my workshop series 'Storytelling Interconnectedness: Situating climate stories in the real and imaginary' for To Okto (Futuring Waters) by Jenny Marketou in Elefsina, Greece. I facilitated digital mapping activities to put participants' lived experiences, climate histories and speculative stories as data in virtual and real landscapes. Another workshop introduced these ideas to local school children in Elefsina. 

Storytelling Interconnectedness is about situating climate stories in the real and imaginary: what does it mean to upload speculative fictions as mapped data points? How can we geolocate the uncertainties we feel about our changing environments over time?

One participant architect Eva Andronikidou created 'Sinking Voices' (2023) during 'Storytelling Interconnectedness' (shown in the image). Eva's mapped story comes from her own experiences of scuba diving into the village she grew up in, which was flooded to create a dam for Athens' drinking water supply. Examples like this narrated both memories of historical environmental changes and incidents, navigated today's continued emotional reflections of displacement, and towards future scenarios for water in the region. 

The workshop was organised as part of 2023 Eleusis European Capital of Culture. 

"Moving between the local environmental histories of Elefsina across real and virtual wetlands, water flows and ancestral mythologies this mapping is part of the publication Futuring Waters: A Speculative Manifesto for and from the Water of Elefsina (2023). It was created during the workshop Constructing Futures a collective exercise which took place in the context of the first part of Marketou’s project Mystery 42, Futuring Waters which took place in June, 2023 at the Old Anapsiktirio in Elefsina for 2023 Eleusis.
