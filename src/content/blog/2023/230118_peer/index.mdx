I shared a conversation with [Dani Admiss](http://www.daniadmiss.com/) of [Sunlight Doesn't Need a Pipeline](https://sunlightdoesntneedapipeline.com/) to discuss some of the overlaps in our practices on working towards climate justice, outside of and with arts institutions. I also discussed the broader issues in the perception of climate arts as being about 'sustainability', by outling current research projects on climaet history, colonialism and greenwashing militarism. 

"Revision is a research and events programme that explores repair, collaboration and evaluation. In response to the ongoing effects of the global pandemic and with increasing calls from artists and art workers to reimagine how we work, this programme acts as a ‘reset’, providing a space to reflect on the work we’ve done, and the work we want to do. In this time no exhibitions will be presented, and the gallery will be used as a site for research and learning through conversation and group work. 

During Revision a series of public talks and workshops will be held at Peer, inviting guest speakers and audiences to playfully and critically reflect on issues relating to the infrastructures and systems that we live and work within. Hackney-based organisation, Engage Here will lead five workshops for local children, young people and their carers that embrace recovery through creative making. Additionally, a series of public talks with artists, writers, researchers and curators will explore issues we want to learn more about as an organisation, such as sustainable economies, social and climate justice, cooperative models, and artistic labour. Throughout Revision Peer will also host closed working groups and gatherings with artists, local residents and partners to collectively review how we work together.

Revision is an organisational learning programme that gives space and time to address how we collaborate, produce and practice through conversation with our communities."
