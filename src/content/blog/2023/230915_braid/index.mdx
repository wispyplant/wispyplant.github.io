As an artist and independent researcher, I was invited by AI policy researcher Bóxī Wú and Professor Shannon Vallor to join the launch of BRAID, a "UK-wide programme dedicated to integrating Arts and Humanities research more fully into the Responsible AI ecosystem." BRAID's aim is also to bridge the divides between academic, industry, policy and regulatory work on responsible AI.

"We are thrilled to launch the BRAID programme to meet this challenge. Delivered in partnership with the Ada Lovelace Institute, and with the help of researchers from the BBC, our interdisciplinary team at the University of Edinburgh will work with academics, policymakers and regulators, civil society, industry and publics across the UK nations to identify and begin to lower the barriers to an AI ecosystem that is responsible, ethical and accountable by default."
