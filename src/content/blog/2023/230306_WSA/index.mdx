(March 6, 2023 → June 19, 2023) For the Spring term, Francis Gene-Rowe and I co-led the Games and Playful Narratives strand for the MA module Global Media 2: Industries and Technologies, in the Department of Art and Media Technology. As a seminar tutor, I led the weekly creative and practical workshops – following Francis' theory sessions – and in these, the student groups created their own digital or paper-based games, through narrative, character, and game design and mechanics. They presented their in-progress and final games for their formative and summative assessments.
