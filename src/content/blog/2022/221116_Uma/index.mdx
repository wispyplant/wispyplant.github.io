Celebrating Uma Breakdown’s gallery exhibition Earth A.D. Uma we spoke together with Dr Tom Dillon on systems of (self)archiving, collapse and repair and queer counter-culture science fiction.

I added how in my work, I approach self-archiving current climate experiences as a way to resist future data gaps in our inherently political climate histories.

Tom Dillon delivered a short presentation on the science fiction writer Michael Moorcock, focusing on his relationship with 60s counterculture and queerness.
