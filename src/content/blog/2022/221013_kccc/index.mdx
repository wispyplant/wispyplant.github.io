King’s Culture Climate Collective supports students’ arts, creativity and storytelling as powerful forces for transforming our climate emergency, and invited Love Ssega and myself to introduce to students of any programme of study to learn more about the intersection of arts and climate justice. We shared our examples of our work and interests before workshopping in smaller groups to ignite students' own ideas for creative change. 

"Presented by King’s Culture Climate Collective - a creative community for climate action. 

Where can we find the strength and creativity to positively engage with our planet’s climate emergency? At this dynamic and participatory event we invite King’s students to join forces with cutting-edge artists to design powerful creative projects that advance climate action.

Featuring environmental artists Love Ssega and Angela YT Chan, Weathervane puts students centre stage in the fight for a sustainable future. Combining inspiring presentations with collective dreaming, Weathervane is your space to find community and develop critical change-making skills through the arts by becoming a part of our newly created King’s Culture Climate Collective."
