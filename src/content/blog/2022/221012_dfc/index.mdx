The Loss and Found Sound Memorial, created by Dissonant Futures, in collaboration with sculpture designer Kevin Logan and sound designers Camilo Tirado and Andréas Saenz De Sicilia, was on tour throughout the UK. As a friend to the project and for its exhibition in Bradford, I joined Dissonant Futures Collective for the installation and launch, speaking to visitors and the local radio about its intentions and themes. 

"The LOSS AND FOUND sound arrangement contains archived sounds of nature, people, and industrial life before 1995, sounds of a life that is no more and yet still echoes into the present, whilst the present-day recordings belong to the voices of participants in workshops we have held around the country. What if we paid attention to the minutiae of what makes up a lifetime?

LOSS AND FOUND has been created by Dissonant Futures, in collaboration with sculpture designer Kevin Logan and sound designers Camilo Tirado and Andréas Saenz De Sicilia. Voices by workshop participants at Common Space in Bradford, BOM in Birmingham and the ‘Meet Me at The Albany’ group at The Albany, London and Dissonant Futures collective members."
