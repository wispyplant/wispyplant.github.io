title: "Climate Justice Riders for Creatives Workshop for the Kaleidoscope Network"
description: "This collective 'climate justice rider' writing exercise saw participants develop a short document that freelancers can send to employers to encourage better practice during contracting. These included asking for transparent commitments, making available the necessary resources and budget to ensure activities are climate and socially responsible. The document will work in a similar way to an Access Rider."

"In this session Angela YT Chan will support us to develop a resource kit or ‘Climate Justice Rider’ for freelance artists and arts workers to extend to employers and institutions that they work with. 

Often institutions programme climate themed events without transparent commitments or can fail to make available the necessary resources and budget to ensure activities are climate and socially responsible. This collective climate justice rider writing exercise will see participants develop a short document that freelancers can send to employers to encourage better practice without needing to write extensive emails to explain why and how climate issues are important. The document will work in a similar way to an Access Rider."

The Kaleidoscope Network is a collaboration between Eastside Projects (Birmingham), Primary (Nottingham), Spike Island (Bristol), The NewBridge Project (Newcastle) and Bloc Projects (Sheffield). 

"A rolling monthly programme of events gives artists in each of our networks access to a range of activity offered by the different partners, enriching our individual programmes and bringing new perspectives and insights from neighbouring networks."
