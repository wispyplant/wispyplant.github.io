(October 20, 2022 → November 22, 2022) The exhibition shows Eelyn Lee's work-in-progress of her project 'Hong Kong Future Diaspora', which invites me and other collaborator through a 'process of devising a series of contemporary mythical characters Centring embodiment, conversation and improvisation, the group has created worlds and characters that forge a speculative ‘Hong Kong-ness.’' 

While I did not make it to perform during the live performance/ritual to bless the opening of the exhibition, choreographer Jan-Ming Lee took my place  for my character The Navigator, and with our rehearsed movements. 

In Eelyn's [words](https://www.eelynlee.com/news/139-hong-kong-future-diaspora-21-oct-19-nov): "I will be exhibitiing work in progress from my latest project, Hong Kong Future Diaspora in a solo show at Bloc Projects, with a special opening performance at the launch event on Thurs 20th Oct 6-8pm.

Hong Kong Future Diaspora is the second cycle of my wider project, Performing Identities that explores what it means to be East and Southeast Asian (ESEA) in the UK today. ⁠Through performance, discussions and an exhibition of past and current documentation of the larger Performing Identities project, the exhibition programme sketches the shifting landscapes of the wandering Hong Konger through past, present and future.

Hong Kong Future Diaspora will continue next year, culminating with an exhibition at Bloc Projects in September 2023 featuring a live performance on the streets of Sheffield and a new moving image work."


Collaborators to date on the project include artists, researchers, martial arts scholars and fellow makers: Clara Cheung, Dr Wayne Wong, Jan-Ming Lee, Angela YT Chan, Anna Chan, Jonathan Tang, Franco Ho, Shan Ray Cheung and Sunshine Wong.
