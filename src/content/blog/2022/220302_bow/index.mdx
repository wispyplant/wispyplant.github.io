I gave a workshop to arts practitioners that encouraged participants to engage with current environmental challenges in the context of the arts and reflect on how artists, makers, and creatives can make their practices more environmentally and socially responsible.

"During the workshop, participants will learn about the decolonial legacies of climate change, taking part in grounding exercises to explore their positionality and bring these issues closer to home. 

Participants will also take part in reflective activities to consider their own individual processes of making and reframe the idea of resourcing and scarcity in the context of the arts – e.g. scarcity of commissions, work, materials, funding. Through this reframing, we will learn how to identify the abundance of opportunities, materials, and resources available beyond the constraints of our current unjust system. 

The final section of the workshop will encourage participants to de-individualise climate change and consider the collective alternatives that artists can take – and are taking – to move towards more environmentally and socially responsible practice and action. 

Bow Skills is a dynamic and relevant programme of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) which is informed by an artist steering group and open to all creative practitioners across London.
