title: "everyday evolutions with our nonhuman neighbours Writing for BABLab Bio-arts Festival, in Birmingham"
description: "I was invited to write an essay to accompany the programme of workshops and printed zine for BAB Lab 2022, which took place 8 – 12 Aug 2022 across different venues around Birmingham. It was a programme of 15 workshops and talks by artists working with living materials; YEAST, FUNGI, CLAY, FLORA and the BODY. I write about the openness of bioarts that resists a definition; deconstructing the criteria for expertise to get involved, and provocations for artists interested in the area."
