I gave a collaging and zine making workshop for young people to 'explore the use of art and photography to address questions of climate justice and the health of the planet, inspired by Autograph's current exhibition Mónica de Miranda: The Island. 

The two other scheduled sessions were unfortunately cancelled due to regristration (summer holidays).
