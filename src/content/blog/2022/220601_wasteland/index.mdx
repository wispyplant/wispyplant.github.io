As part of Creative Posthumanism, a research series led by [Megen de Bruin-Molé](https://frankenfiction.com/author/megen/) at WSA, [Cristina Diamant](https://linktr.ee/C.C.Diamant) and I - co-directors of the [LSFRC](https://www.lsfrc.co.uk/) - delivered a workshop for participants to create toolkits as an imagined response to 'Posthumanist Terror Management' and rethinking the possibilites in the 'wasteland'. 

"The five areas of concern for our workshop are the mix of extractive practices that (re)produces wastelands and the four acute stress responses: fight, flight, freeze, and fawn. We will attempt to reconfigure the relationship between our own situated embodiments and technological developments from a more-than-human ethical perspective, acknowledging the affect behind our response and confronting the biases that hold us back."
