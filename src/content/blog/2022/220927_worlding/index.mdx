(September 27, 2022 → October 4, 2022) Together with socially-engaged artist Hwa Young Jung and Ruth McCullough (director, Abandon Normal Devices), we made up team WILD NATURES for the first WORLDING. The 2-week intensive programme aimed to develop potentials for co-creative processes with real-time 3D with Hwa Young's project – a paper-based game made with young people excluded from mainstream education in Northwest England, that explores on their terms the intersection of criminal and environmental justice. 


"Co-Creation Studio at MIT Open Documentary Lab (ODL) is announcing a cohort of five projects for WORLDING, a workshop in partnership with Unity, the world’s leading platform for creating and operating real-time 3D (RT3D) content. This first-of-its kind research and development workshop explores climate futures at the intersection of documentary, land-use planning, speculative modelling and game-engine technologies, and is supported through a Unity Charitable Fund grant.

During the two-week intensive workshop, teams will have a unique opportunity to develop their projects with researchers and makers from MIT, Unity team members, along with special guests from the field, to explore how they use (or could use) realtime 3D technology to imagine, plan and co-create future worlds within real-life communities. The workshop will include a custom-curated program specifically developed for the teams.

“Now more than ever, we need to forge shared narratives about the world that we live in today and the world that we want to build for the future. Technology can help us visualize and communicate those worlds, and Unity is thrilled to support changemakers and worldbuilders who are doing this important work” said Marina Psaros, Head of Sustainability at Unity."
