Along with Dissonant Futures at Collective members Line Langebek, Baff Akoto and Rebecca Kenyon, I joined the day at BOM where we held an open drop-in to take part in a VR process in the creation of a new collaborative public artwork that explores climate grief and hope.

"Dissonant Futures is a multidisciplinary collective, which develops immersive narrative experiences that encourage us all to confront and discuss ecological loss, translating our explorations and emotional journeys into meaningful solidarity and climate action."
