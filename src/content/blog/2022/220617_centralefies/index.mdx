description: "I delivered a workshop that guided the participants to reshape their idea of what can constitute 'climate data' by creating a paper-based mood tracker customised with their main concerns to journal their evolving relationship with the changing climate. The session opened with conversations about how the youth group felt about climate change from their own experiences, engagements with the issues and their thoughts on the near future, before ideating and producing stencils for their own use.

(June 17, 2022 → June 19, 2022) I delivered a workshop that guided the participants to reshape their idea of what can constitute 'climate data' by creating a paper-based mood tracker customised with their main concerns to journal their evolving relationship with the changing climate. The session opened with conversations about how the youth group felt about climate change from their own experiences, engagements with the issues and their thoughts on the near future, before ideating and producing stencils for their own use. 

"apap_FEMINIST FUTURES is the program dedicated to the current four-year project of apap_advancing performing art project, the longest-running European network of performing art centers and festivals. FEMINIST FUTURES, the new project of the network, has among its main objectives that of experimenting with practices aimed at countering inequalities in contemporary performing arts, drawing inspiration from Intersectional Feminism to find concrete structural answers and raise public awareness. The performative works supported by apap will be accompanied by the FEMINIST School, a series of meetings designed to foster a constant exchange of practices and knowledge."

"From 17 to 19 June Centrale Fies brings the European network of apap – Feminist Futures back to its spaces . A project inspired by the concepts of 'intersectional' feminism, apap imagines futures by rethinking bodies; ours, others, the most fragile, animal, vegetal and even those that we forget are fragile like air, water or the earth itself.
