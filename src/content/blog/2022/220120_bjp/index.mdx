description: "For the series 'Creating Change, Decade of Change' I was featured in the British Journal of Photography with an interview by Jamila Prowse.

I described my methods of approach, such as through the colonial history of climate change and amplifying counternarratives as a decolonial tool. I also critiqued the trend of co-opting climate arts in the secotr by institutions and pratitioners, and what it may take to be an arts sector more aligned to climate justice.  "
