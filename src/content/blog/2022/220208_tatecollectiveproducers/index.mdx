title: "Your Climate Stories: Thinking About Research and Perspectives Workshop with Tate Collective Producers for Tate St Ives"
description: "For the youth group Tate Collective Producers, I delivered a story workshop that encouraged participants to relate climate issues globally and locally to their everyday experiences. Through story telling devices like character, plotline and tone construction, my activities asked them to engage critically with everyday climate related materials ie. news, music, art work, adverts, and write their own desired story tangents or revised endings as a way to consider their own agency.
