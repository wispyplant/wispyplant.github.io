I delivered a workshop for Bow Arts as part of their Visions in the Nunnery, #FirstThursdays Late Opening.

"Using speculative fiction and sci-fi as a springboard, join Angela YT Chan in this workshop about how we can use fiction as a vehicle to imagine, agitate, and move towards new climate and ecological narratives that speak to our own experiences.    

In the session, Angela will be guiding us through a range of activities that explore worldbuilding and the various ways to visualise fiction, including and extending beyond just words. The three main strategies of fictioning that will be covered are doodles, diagrams, and text. 

Angela encourages participants to keep in mind the key themes of climate change, justice, people, planet, and ecology. But, please do come to the session with any other related ideas or topics that you find interesting!"
