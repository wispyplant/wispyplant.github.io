(October 1, 2022 → October 8, 2022)  I delivered a presentation with project examples of how I approach my research and art practices through climate change histories for the Fifth Edition of The Curatorial Thing and by the invitation of Heidi Hart. I also spoke on a panel with other researchers - Ariana Kalliga and Beatriz Colomina (keynote) - who presented alongside me in our session titled 'Regenerative Architectures in Climate Art History Perspective'. 


"SixtyEight Art Institute will be hosting its world-class intensive art and knowledge programme, The Curatorial Thing (in the Nordic sense of “assembly”) October 1-8, 2022 in Copenhagen. The 5th Edition of The Curatorial Thing will build on SixtyEight’s ongoing exhibition programme, Memoirs of Saturn, which envisions potentials for prosperity in a warming world.  This week-long program is composed of participating professionals and theorists who are shaping the intersection of art, science, and curatorial applied knowledge. As such, this letter is our invitation to have you join us as a speaker in our public lecture programme. Your far-reaching work on contemporary artworks, climate framings, and power structures will enrich this interdisciplinary gathering of researchers, curators, and artists, in a time when critical imaginations on climate crisis and amelioration are urgently needed. 

The Curatorial Thing brings an international group of selected curators and other culture professionals into this weeklong programme that includes both workshops for invited participants and a series of public lectures. We have chosen the title AUDACIOUS LANDSCAPES, from a 1938 poem by Muriel Rukeyser on witnessing an industrial landscape with “clouds over every town” that “indicate the stored destruction” on the eve of war. As this carbon buildup has led to global climate crisis, with additional conflicts rising around us, curatorial practice has become a form of witness, too. We read “audacious” as describing a paradox of both capitalist hubris and the risk of imagining better possible afterlives. This signature event encompasses new thinking on climate grief as a tactical opening toward ameliorative efforts in research, artworks, design, and curatorial practices. 

The 2022 programme will lay the infrastructure for a longer-term knowledge gathering and publishing initiative inspired in large part by our invited speakers. A lecture that draws on your work on climate crisis and rethinking geographies through art will add fresh perspective to a programme concerned with climate art histories, ameliorative infrastructures, critical communication in these uncertain times, and ways of moving from a modernising to an ecologising mindset. Confirmed keynote speakers are T.J. Demos, Andri Snær Magnason, Beatriz Colomina, and Diedrich Diederichsen."
