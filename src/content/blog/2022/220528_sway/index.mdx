As part SWAY, I led a walk and talk which explored the shoreline as a site to consider colonial climate histories and present timelines, and the connected struggles of displacement and migration in a world of border building.

"At low tide we can observe both downstream trickles of water into the sea and the sea’s waves returning back to the shore - an ongoing shaping and remaking of the porous borders  between land and water.  Continuing Angela’s previous work on water stories - specifically around migration, daily water practices and the historical context of water in colonial extractivism - this discursive walk will explore how we can use our shores to think together about the processes that create barriers of migration for those who are most unjustly impacted by the climate crises and intersecting struggles."
