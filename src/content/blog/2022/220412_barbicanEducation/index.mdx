I delivered 'ethical consultation' to Barbican Creative Learning to create Learning Resources for Key Stage 2 and 3 school pupils, through teacher 'notes, presentations, activities and source material to explore the subject matter creatively while linking across the national curriculum. Other consultants to the project were Angela Camacho and Sarah Melia.'  

"Bring Our Time on Earth into the classroom with our series of classroom resources that go further into specific artworks in the exhibition.

Aimed at Key Stage 2 and 3, these provide teachers with notes, presentations, activities and source material to explore the subject matter creatively while linking across the national curriculum. 
 
With our Primary series, wow your students with the complexity of Soil, inspire them to look differently at their Local Wildlife, and invite them to throw a Multi-Species Banquet.
 
With our Secondary series, explore Indigenous wisdom for keys to planetary survival, discover biomaterials and sci-fi to think up the future of Fashion, and recognise the role of Cities as the heart of both the problem and solution to the climate emergency.
 
These Learning Resources were created by Hannah Calascione for Barbican Creative Learning, with ethical consultation from Angela Chan, Angela Camacho and Sarah Melia."
