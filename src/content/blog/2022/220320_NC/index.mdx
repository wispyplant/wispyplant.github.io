I moderated this keynote in which art historian and cultural critic TJ Demos speculated on what comes after growth through looking into practices of Indigenous and Afrofuturism. The talk concluded 'After Growth: A Symposium on Post-Capitalist Imaginaries', which 'assembled a diverse array of visions, organisations, and initiatives to speculate on the possibility of life after growth.'  

"After Growth Symposium was part of Emergency and Emergence, the multi-platform research programme that unearths transdisciplinary, sensorial and speculative practices of radical sensemaking and wayfinding via questions of repair, pedagogy, remediation and mutation."

The talk is also published as part of The Contemporary Journal, the online publishing platform of Nottingham Contemporary in the edition Emergency and Emergence (April 2022 - December 2023). The issue 'unearths transdisciplinary, sensorial and speculative practices of radical sensemaking and wayfinding via questions of repair, pedagogy, remediation and mutation.' Edited by Canan Batur.
