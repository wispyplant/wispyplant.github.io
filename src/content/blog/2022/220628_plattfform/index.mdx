I delivered a workshop that guided the young cohort to reshape their idea of what can constitute 'climate data' by creating a paper-based mood tracker customised with their main concerns to journal their evolving relationship with the changing climate. The session opened with conversations about how the youth group felt about climate change from their own experiences, engagements with the issues and their thoughts on the near future, before ideating and producing stencils for their own use. 

"In Summer 2022, Platfform Haf brought together a group of eight young people to make, share, listen and imagine with artists, writers, geologists and activists. Gathering around ways of thinking about climate change, hope, power and collective making, the group explored kinship in nature, personal climate languages, deep time, resources of hope and how we carry questions for the future. 

The programme was hosted at Platfform 2 - a site we believe has great potential for bringing together different voices and languages to think differently about futures in Wales - as part of Casgleb, a year-long research and development project in collaboration with artists and young people, hosted by Peak  and Transport for Wales at Abergavenny Train Station. 

Platfform Haf was open to anyone aged 18-25 living within one hour of Abergavenny, and through an open call process supported by young people who have previously taken part in Peakâ€™s programmes, the selected group was: Robin Eaton, Felix Stevenson-Davies, Chloe Winder, Penelope Gammon, Saskia McKay, Izzy McLeod, Aisling Edwards and Ffion Williams. The artists, writers, geologists and activists who contributed to the programme were: Jess Tanner, Durre Shahwar, Cerys Scorey, Angela YT Chan, Heledd C Evans, Gwenllian Spink, Sion Marshall Waters, Rory Pilgrim, Taylor Edmonds, Alan Bowring."
