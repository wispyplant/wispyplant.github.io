Storytelling Interconnectedness is about situating climate stories in the real and imaginary: what does it mean to upload speculative fictions as mapped data points? How can we geolocate the uncertainties we feel about our changing environments over time? (December 3, 2022 → December 4, 2022) "

(December 3, 2022 → December 4, 2022)  I held a digital mapping workshop for TIDAL's Digital Artist Development Lab that combined climate storytelling with lived experiences of change, memories of places and future visioning. Storytelling Interconnectedness is about situating climate stories in the real and imaginary: what does it mean to upload speculative fictions as mapped data points? How can we geolocate the uncertainties we feel about our changing environments over time? 

"T I D A L, is Signal Film and Media's digital arts programme which explored Barrow’s coastal environment & the climate emergency through free development opportunities including talks, workshops and engagements with the coast throughout 2023 to 2024, for artists with a strong connection to Cumbria. 

The lab was a weekend of talks, workshops and visits to inspiring locations in and around Barrow. Space was created for artists to build new networks, share and get feedback about work and ideas in progress and gain skills and knowledge around using digital technology and the natural environment within a creative practice."
