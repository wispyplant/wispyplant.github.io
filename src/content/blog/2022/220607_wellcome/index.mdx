(June 7, 2022 → August 6, 2022) I curated an creative, open workshop series for young people that centred air pollution issues relating to climate, health and race justice, working with Dr Chloe Trainor at Wellcome Collection throughout August 2022. The events and guest workshop facilitators are Claire Ratinon, Sam Ayre, Janine Francois, Scarlett Westbrook and Love Ssega. 

I also designed an accompanying leaflet as an introduction to key ideas and how-tos - downloadable [here](https://wellcomecollection.cdn.prismic.io/wellcomecollection/ed0831ca-123b-4740-88d1-542f1cff6236_A+Breath+of+fresh+Air+resource+PDF.pdf).
