I spoke together with Maggie Matić, Marie Smith, Becky Warnock, Heather Agyepong and the panel chair Professor Mark Sealy (Autograph ABP) on the role of art as a form of critical communication and engagement for climate and social justice, pointing out the distractions, challenges and hope. 

- 'How can we continue to act and make small but meaningful changes towards social justice work and the climate emergency?' 

- 'How can institutions and arts practitioners learn from artists to support and amplify social justice practices and how can we make networks of care visible and meaningful?' 

"Join artists and practitioners for a discussion and reflection on best practice for supporting and developing social justice practices within arts organisations. Learn from artists and practitioners already working in this way to think through actions that can be taken forward to work with care and intention to foreground social justice practice.  Bringing together artists and curators who foreground access, visibility, care and collaboration in their practices, we will think through current barriers and restrictions that slow the process of change in institutional contexts."
