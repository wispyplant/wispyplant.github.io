(January 24, 2022 → January 28, 2022) For the second iteration of this cross-college programme for the School of Arts & Humanities' School Group (open to students of any study discipline), painting tutor Jesse Ash and I co-led a week of workshops about environmentally and socially more responsible arts practices. 

- Our first iteration of An Ecology of Making was held between Monday 18th October  – Friday 22nd October 2021, with students from the MA programmes Ceramics & Glass, Painting, Print, Sculpture, Curating Contemporary Art. 

- Our second iteration was held between Monday 24th January – Friday 28th January 2022, with students from the MA programmes Jewellery and Metal, Contemporary Art Practice, Photography, Painting, Print. 

"The MA Groups are led by academic staff and visiting lecturers who are all leaders in their fields. The Groups offer the opportunity for MA students from across SoAH’s 10 Programmes to meet and collaborate around a set theme, for one intensive week.

For the Groups programme, the overall academic focus for the year was aimed at articulating ‘The Urgency of the Arts’. The Groups seeks to 'add a plurality of voices that speak to the ‘why’ of what it is that we do – as artists, writers, historians, curators, and practitioners of all sorts – and in particular, why these voices are so vital in our current socio-political environment."
