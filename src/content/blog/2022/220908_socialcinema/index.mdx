I enjoyed Social Cinema London's screening of climated-related sci-fi short films, including Pumzi (2009) directed by Wanuri Kahiu, before joining Anna Mill and Francis Gene-Rowe to talk about social, racial and environmental justice narratives in science fiction. 

Join The Social Cinema London for the first screening of FRAMEBURN, a series of screenings and events dedicated to science-fiction, future climates and activism. The programme starts with an evening dedicated to sci-fi short films that speculate on changing climates and a panel discussion with Angela YT Chan, Francis Gene-Rowe (in place of Caroline Edwards) and Anna Mill. The talk will explore connections between social, racial and environmental injustice.
