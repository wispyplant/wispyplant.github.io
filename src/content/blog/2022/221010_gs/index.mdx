(October 10, 2022 → October 16, 2022) I taught a module strand to introduce and broaden students' understandings of the colonial histories of climate change, and how to build their own interdisciplinary critical engagements and arts projects within their existing and explorative practices. The weekly themes I led to facilitate lecture and seminar sessions are as follows: 

1. Power Timelines of Climate Change
   - Colonial histories and the power structures behind visualising climate change - from natural history collections to contemporary arts.

2. Critical Inspiration in Artistic Research
    - Group Visit to Mosaic Rooms with a tour by the director Rachael to see Marwa Arsanios' exhibition 'Reverse Shot', which explores the "colonial and ecological violence and the alternative possibilities in grassroots community resistance and a more harmonious relationship with the land."

3. Politics of Knowledge Production
    - People and solidarities in cultural and scientific production of knowledge.

4. Multi-species Approaches to Climate Justice
    - Trans-species communion as an inspiration to the way we stand in allyship. 

5. Collective presentations 
    - Performance and text-based creative presentations to the rest of the module cohort.
