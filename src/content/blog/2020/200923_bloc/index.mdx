For Bloc Projects' webinar series Harsh Light, which sought to 'offer solace and critique at a time of health crisis and cultural change', I invited Farah Ahmed to be in conversation with me. We discussed our experiences working in the overlap of arts and climate change at in various spaces of the sector and movement, and shared our concerns about some of the current challenges the cause faces. 

"For the second webinar in the series, we are delighted to invite Angela YT Chan and Farah Ahmed to talk about the intersection of climate activism and the arts in the UK. The speakers are steeped in both worlds and are having an ongoing conversation about the challenges of merging the two in different ways. Amongst other things, Angela and Farah will explore bringing activism into art production, the disconnect of the art world from decolonisation and movement organising, and the problematic curation of climate emergency."
