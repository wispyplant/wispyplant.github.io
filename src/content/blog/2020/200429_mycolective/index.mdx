(April 29, 2020 → May 11, 2021) I joined Myco-Lective, a programme for artists engaging with ecological thinking, climate change, and multispecies futures. It took its inspiration from human and non-human models of education, collective action, care, reciprocal networking, and mutual aid, including the mycorrhizal networks of the forest, where plants share nourishment and knowledge via the under-soil web of fungal mycelium. We met regularly online for a year, supporting each other through a rotation of workshops and discussions. 

Myco-Lective was developed and facilitated by Feral Practice (Fiona MacDonald+) in association with Chisenhale Studios. Fiona brought her experience in artist development, posthumanist thought, practices of attention and multispecies aesthetics. The lead artist was speculative writer and researcher Ama Josephine Budge, who brought her expertise in queer identity, speculative fictioning and climate colonialism, and co-held the initial sessions with great warmth and care. 

After the first few sessions, all the participants  - Joseph Morgan Schofield, Sonia Barrett, Angela Chan, Linda Persson, Laurèl Hadleigh and Sam Hodge - lead and followed, held space, listened and learned together. The programme was shaped in and became our creative relationship. So, even as the formal bit ends, Myco-Lective continues to grow."
