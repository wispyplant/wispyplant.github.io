title: "Intersectional Climate Justice with the RawMinds Ambassadors for Wellcome Collection"
description: "Over a few months, I worked with the Wellcome Collection's youth group the RawMinds Ambassadors aged 14-19  to introduce the ideas that shape intersectional climate justice - how overlapping challenges such as social, disability and racial justice issues, are all interconnected and influenced by the changing climate. Through my weekly series of activities and exercises, we explored different areas of the youths' own concerns and experiences of the issues - all also in the frame of living through the first pandemic lockdowns. To culminate the programme, the youth group collectively created apublic panel talk for other young people to explore the globally uneven climate impacts of food, ‘sustainable’ fashion and futures.(April 23, 2020 → September 23, 2020)"
