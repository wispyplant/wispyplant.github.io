title: "From West to East: Re-Locating a Speculative Centre Writing Published with Ama Josephine Budge for MIT Press and Whitechapel Gallery's Science Fiction"
description: "I was invited to contribute to the Science Fiction edition of the Whitechapel: Documents of Contemporary Art series, and with a preference to co-author, I in turn invited Ama Josephine Budge to collaborate with me. Together we co-wrote an article of the conversation we had at Iniva and the Stuart Hall Library on speculative fictions. The publication, edited by Dan Byrne-Smith, is 'the first major anthology to focus on relationships between science fiction and contemporary art, with topics ranging from accelerating technological change to global urbanization.' Unfortunately the press and editor erased my name from the credits, and mistitled our article to misname our co-authorship. "
