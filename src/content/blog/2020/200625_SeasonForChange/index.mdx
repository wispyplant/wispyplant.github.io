title: "Common Ground Briefing Talk for Arts Admin's Season for Change"
description: "For artists looking to applying to The Common Ground commissions, I was invited by hosts Season for Change, Julie's Bicycle  and Metal Liverpool to deliver an artist talk to frame the concepts of climate justice, aligned to racial and social justice issues, with artistic methods and projects. I was asked to speak about why I, as a curator, foreground amplifying artists of minoritised backgrounds, and how artists considering applying for these commissions could ensure they work towards a climate justice agenda, with social and planetary wellbeing at the heart of how they work.

For artists looking to applying to The Common Ground commissions, I was invited by hosts Season for Change, Julie's Bicycle  and Metal Liverpool to deliver an artist talk to frame the concepts of climate justice, aligned to racial and social justice issues, with artistic methods and projects. I was asked to speak about why I, as a curator, foreground amplifying artists of minoritised backgrounds, and how artists considering applying for these commissions could ensure they work towards a climate justice agenda, with social and planetary wellbeing at the heart of how they work. 

"Common Ground is produced and hosted by Metal Liverpool as part of Season for Change. Running until April 2021, Season for Changeâ€™s Common Ground initiative supports four UK-based artists and makers to create collaborative works centered around underrepresented communities in the climate movement.""
