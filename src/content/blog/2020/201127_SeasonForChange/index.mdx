Alongside science fiction and fantasty researcher and librarian Phoenix Alexander, we co-delivered a talk and workshop for artists working on the Common Ground commission with Metal Liverpool, Julie's Bicycle and Arts Admin's Season for Change. For the Common Ground Artists Lab, we shared our practices before workshopping with narrative tools for intersectional and climate justice theme speculative visioning. 

"Common Ground is produced and hosted by Metal Liverpool as part of Season for Change. Running until April 2021, Season for Changeâ€™s Common Ground initiative supports four UK-based artists and makers to create collaborative works centered around underrepresented communities in the climate movement."
