For Amelia Hawk's podcast Otherwise Silent, I joined artist and activist Amelia and artist and horticulturist Sahjan Kooner in conversation about our lived experiences relating to ecologies. We spoke together about 'land rights, ancestral knowledge and flora. They explore issues that connect climate action and race, whilst touching on wider issues of power and how we navigate power structures to create spaces for solidarity and action.' 

"This episode is kindly supported by a-n, artists newsletter and the sound is composed by Zach Dawson. Presented by artist and activist Amelia Hawk."

"Otherwise Silent is a podcast aiming to raise the voice of people and issues that are perhaps a little bit quiet. The podcastâ€™s initial series touches on subjects ranging from mental health to homelessness, with personal stories alongside interviews with people working on the front line. Created and hosted by artist and activist Amelia Hawk alongside her son who occasionally contributes with background vocals."
