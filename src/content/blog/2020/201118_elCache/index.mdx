For 3hd Festival, El Hardwick and I talked together about our term Cache Histories as a metaphor for an internet-age container, gathering SF storytelling, political crises and time in the context of practising counternarratives towards climate and digital justice.

"As part of this year’s 3hd Festival, I recorded a conversation with my hugely talented, thoughtful friend Angela Chan — which was aired on 18 November 2020, on @MontezPressRadio as a 1 hour radio show titled ‘Cache Histories’." - El Hardwick 

"In reference to Ursula K Le Guin’s Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction, Angela Chan and El Hardwick use the term Cache Histories as a metaphor for an internet-age container, to discuss how science fiction stores histories. By using SF storytelling as a space for dreaming and imagining, we can examine overlapping political crises, and strategise for alternatives to the frameworks and histories that have been recorded, stored, extracted, distributed, duplicated and erased by dominant narratives. Angela and El also consider how our perception of time alters how we remember our past - as a way to move towards climate and digital justice."
