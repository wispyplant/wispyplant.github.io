Co-created and co-presented in collaboration with [MIGRANT Journal](https://migrantjournal.com/pages/about), I joined this session with Michaela Büsse, Anca Benera and Arnold Estefan, and moderated by Michelle Kasprzak for Fiber Festival, in Session 4: Radical Streams. I delivered a version of my paper 'Climate Change and Contemporary Chinese Science and Speculative Fiction: Invisible, Extractive and Uneven Boundaries', adapted from the LSFRC conference Beyond Borders and joined the other speakers for a joint discussion. 

"Radical Streams investigates material transformation in this age of planetary crisis. We will explore politics of resource-making, logistics of resource extraction and narratives of landscape design – and how they relate to each other. How can we use the material as a vehicle to explore converging and diverging scales and worlding practices? In what way can speculative design, cartography, art and science fiction help to better grasp these ‘radical streams’?

In this panel, we will shed light on the entanglement between colonial and neocolonial histories, materiality and narratives of the future."

"FIBER Festival is an Amsterdam based festival that showcases contemporary digital culture, audiovisual art, speculative design and forward thinking music culture to enhance other world views. Through the lens of the visual arts the festival reflects upon the ever shifting impact of technology on society and the environment. The festival annually explores these matters collectively through lectures, installation art, performances and by learning from pioneering creative making-processes."
