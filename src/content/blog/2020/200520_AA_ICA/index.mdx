title: "Futures of Waste: Articulated Knowledges and Speculative Stories Lecture for AA x ICA"
description: "For Architectural Association and ICA's Speculative Studies: Art and Ecology strand for postgraduates, I shared recent research and curatorial projects on knowledge systems, climate speculative fiction and the colonial history of climate change. In the second part of the session, I led an exploration into some sinophone speculative fiction that discuss these issues. Focusing on waste, from e-waste management to incinerator activism, the seminar expanded on the actors, processes and challenges of globalised consumerism and the industry of waste. We read Hao Jingfang’s short science fiction story ‘Folding Beijing’, and discussed the social and ecological impacts, and how stories can help frame justice on a global level. "

For Architectural Association and ICA's Speculative Studies: Art and Ecology strand for postgraduates, I shared recent research and curatorial projects on knowledge systems and climate speculative fiction. Investigating the power structures of climate and environmental knowledge systems, this work confronts issues of injustice that permeate from the colonial history of climate change. 

What constitutes knowledge about climate change? Who is in control of producing and sharing information? How does this information benefit or compromise marginalised groups? 

In the second part of the session, I led an exploration into some sinophone speculative fiction that discuss these issues. Focusing on waste, from e-waste management to incinerator activism, the seminar expanded on the actors, processes and challenges of globalised consumerism and the industry of waste. With particular attention to Hao Jingfang’s short science fiction story ‘Folding Beijing’, we discussed the social and ecological impacts, and how stories can help frame justice on a global level.

"Speculative Studies explores issues of contemporary culture
through the study of other disciplines and practices and their
relation to architecture. Exposing students to other fields, research
methodologies, historiographies and modes of action, Speculative
Studies brings together a wide range of disciplines including
anthropology, art, biology, ecology, economics, geology, law,
philosophy and politics among others to learn and identify relevant
forms of activism and action."

"Addressing complex issues such as identity, value, sustainability,
postcolonialism, agency, authority, and ethics, these seminars
are taught by practitioners, theorists and pedagogues who are
able to translate and communicate highly complex issues into the
classroom for open debate and discussion.
Consisting of lectures, debates and experimental pedagogical
formats, each seminar consists of 5 sessions with a group of 15
students (maximum) from the second year (Core Curriculum) and
the Diploma, Post-Graduate and PhD programme (Electives).   

This session addresses the current ecological crises facing
our contemporary moment. Considering art’s relation to
environmentalism, a key issue in contemporary culture, this
session will explore forms of knowledge sharing, care (towards
self, community and ecologies) and social justice. Considering
the context of patriarchal white supremacy and disaster
capitalism that operates systematically in both the arts and
environmentalism, Angela Chan will lead discussions on how
various creative practices offer strategies and inspiration for
people to work together towards climate justice."
