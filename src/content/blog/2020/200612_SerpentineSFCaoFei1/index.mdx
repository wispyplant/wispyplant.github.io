Commissioned as an accompanying text to Cao Fei's exhibition Blueprints at Serpentine, I was invited to create a written response to the artist's science fictional themes in her films. I extended this conversation to science fiction writers Gu Shi and Regina Kanyu Wang (also an SF editor), and together, we discussed the context of Chinese SF throughout history and today. We touched on Cao Fei's films, Whose Utopia (2006), RMB City: A Second Life City Planning (2007), Asia One (2018), 1.1 (2018) and Nova (2019), to explore of the topics in Cao Fei's works that resonate with the authors, such as rapid industrialisation, technology, labour, and the changing shapes of interpersonal relationships throughout society.
