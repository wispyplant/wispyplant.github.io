title: "[Export_Explode> Artwork Commission for Metal Culture and Estuary 2021 at Wat Tyler Country Park"
description: "I was commissioned by Metal Culture to create an artwork that responds to the sites for Estuary 2021 (originally Estuary 2020, postponed due to the pandemic). During the artwork commission, I researched into former Pitsea Explosives Factory on the Thames Estuary. It produced munitions at the height of the Industrial Revolution, and is at the site of Wat Tyler Country Park, which is now an RSPB bird watching nature reserve. I created a video essay highlighting this history and the contradictions of the histories of extraction and of the British Empire alongside contemporary access to nature, all considering a climate justice approach. See more about [Export_Explode> on my artwork post. (March 18, 2020 → June 12, 2021)"

(March 18, 2020 → June 12, 2021) I was commissioned by Metal Culture to create an artwork that responds to the sites for Estuary 2021 (originally Estuary 2020, postponed due to the pandemic). During the artwork commission, I researched into former Pitsea Explosives Factory on the Thames Estuary. It produced munitions at the height of the Industrial Revolution, and is at the site of Wat Tyler Country Park, which is now an RSPB bird watching nature reserve. I created a video essay highlighting this history and the contradictions of the histories of extraction and of the British Empire alongside contemporary access to nature, all considering a climate justice approach.

"The second edition, Estuary 2021 took place on the river itself, and along the 107 miles of South Essex and North Kent coastline. Artworks were set in the landscape, online and within Covid-safe venues, led by a partnership between estuary-based arts organisations, with Metal and Cement Fields. Estuary 2021 was possible through Creative Estuary, an ambitious long-term project to make the Thames Estuary the world's largest creative corridor. It attracted over 200k live audiences, 107,854 digital audiences and 45 million reached through media."
