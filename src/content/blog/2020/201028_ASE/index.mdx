I was invited to join as a respondent to participants for the online co-research workshop organised by The Alternative School Of Economics. 'An online co-research workshop looking at deep time from hundreds to millions of years, from the human brain to the formation of our planet, to understand both the physical preconditions and human perception of our environment, its resources and resulting crisis.' 

With guests Nicolas Angelides and Philip Mannion, and Angela Chan and Chamkaur Ghag as respondents.

"The three workshop was part of a series of public events for The Alternative School Of Economics (artists Ruth Beale and Amy Feneck)'s residency The End of the Present with Arts Catalyst. Running from July to December 2020, they explored the interdependencies of financial structures, global events, the mass of the universe and time itself through parallel research and a programme of conversations."
