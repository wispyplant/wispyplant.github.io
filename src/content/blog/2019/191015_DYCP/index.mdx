Under my curatorial project name Worm: art + ecology, this research aimed to continue my long-term development of cross-cultural projects in the form of online and gallery exhibitions, workshops, publications and featured online artists profiles.

(October 15, 2019 → December 02, 2019)I was granted the DYCP award to realise my research trip to Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China to research & connect with climate arts activities and networks in East Asia during winter 2019. Under my curatorial project name Worm: art + ecology, this research aimed to continue my long-term development of cross-cultural projects in the form of online and gallery exhibitions, workshops, publications and featured online artists profiles. The trip allowed for me to visit, connect and research with artists, curators, community collectives and science fiction writers in Taipei, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai. 

My research inquired how the arts may communicate climate change and work in cultural alliance with the global climate justice movement, which became an invaluable opportunity to develop networks across East Asia to deepen an understanding of the breadth of climate arts, community initiatives and curatorial methods in this setting.
