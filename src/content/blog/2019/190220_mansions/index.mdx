title: "The Colonial History of Climate Change Talk at Mansions of the Future in Lincoln"
description: "For the Wednesday Sessions public talk series, I presented an introductory talk on the colonial history of global climate change and how it continues to disperse uneven consequences across our human and natural geographies. 'Part of Wednesday Sessions, a 6-month programme of talks curated by Mansions of the Future. The Wednesday Sessions will highlight artistic practices which are based on collaborative and collective processes, where art is actively and critically engaged with its immediate context. This series focuses on models of working which suggest new connections and ecologies between artists and non-artists, humans and nature, the individual and the collective, and modes of operation often stemming from feminist practices.'"

"Mansions of the Future [was] a three year arts and cultural hub in Lincoln brought to life through a public programme of talks, workshops, communal lunches and family activities, alongside national and international artistic commissions. 2020 marks our final, legacy year."
