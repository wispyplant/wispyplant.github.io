As part of Sin Wai Kin's long-term project Dream Babes, I held a session that introduced Chinese science fiction for the their reading group with Live Art UK. We discussed two short stories, 'Folding Beijing', a novelette by Hao Jinfang (winner of the 2016 Hugo Award for Best Novelette) and 'Good Hunting' by Ken Liu.

'Dream Babes [was] a long-term project led by Sin Wai Kin in collaboration with Auto Italia featuring artists using speculative fiction as a productive medium for intersectional queer experience, bringing together practitioners working across varied mediums to enact worlds that we are for, with others.

This project comprises many iterations, public moments and opportunities to come together. To date, Dream Babes has manifested as a reading group, an event â€“ Speculative Sex, a three-day live programme and most recently a Speculative Futures Zine Launch in collaboration with the Horse Hospital.'
