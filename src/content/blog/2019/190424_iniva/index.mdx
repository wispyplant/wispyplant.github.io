title: "Speculative Climate Stories Talk for Research Network: More-than-Human Care at Iniva"
description: "In this talk, I shared research on communicating climate change through contemporary Chinese speculative and science fiction, and explored the interconnected environmental and socio-economic issues in China today. Responding to my presentation, writer, curator and artist Ama Josephine Budge discussed speculative climate fiction from a West African perspective. Our discussion emphasised a positionality as global North diaspora, to collectively engage with speculative climate fiction in solidarity with global BIPOC-led climate justice activism."

In this talk, I shared research on communicating climate change through contemporary Chinese speculative and science fiction, and explored the interconnected environmental and socio-economic issues in China today.

"Reading excerpts from selected speculative climate stories, they will navigate how storytelling imaginatively and critically rejects climate colonialism. Whilst decentralising the Western ‘cli-fi’ discourse, they will also problematise the limited debate in Chinese ‘cli-fi’ on the growing political concerns over China’s expanding economic relations with African nations for natural resources."

"This year’s Research Network, selected through open call, will expand on the previous series Duties of Self-Care with artists looking deeper into the complexities of our relationship with ourselves, each other and the earth. Knowledge and affect are spun between humans and non-humans, resources flow and power is abused. We exist in relation to each other, ancestors, elements, spirits, computers, bacteria, planets and plants. Self-care necessitates collective care. More-than-Human Care challenges structural oppressions and enables us to understand our intersecting existences."
