(April 1, 2019 → April 31, 2019) Throughout April 2019, Arts Catalyst in partnership with The Otolith Collective hosted Undisciplinary. This new, month-long Residency provided an infrastructure for research, experimentation and production. I and two other emerging cultural practitioners Aliyah Hasinah and Priya Jay, were chosen for our experimental approach to curatorial, artistic and critical practices that seek to engage with the challenge of current social, political and ecological crises. We were based at a dedicated research space will be available at Arts Catalyst with mentorship from Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun of The Otolith Collective. 

"The Residency is an ideal opportunity for emerging artists and curators to focus upon reflection, discussion and framing of their work. A dedicated research space will be available at Arts Catalyst throughout April 2019 for presentations that make public the scale, scope and detail of each ongoing inquiry."

"The Otolith Collective expands on the work of The Otolith Group, which was founded in 2002 by Anjalika Sagar and Kodwo Eshun. It is a curatorial platform through which exhibition-making, artists’ writing, workshops, publication and teaching aim to engender intergenerational and cross-cultural thought. The Collective has been influential in introducing the work of figures such as Black Audio Film Collective, Harun Farocki, Chimurenga, Mark Fisher and Justin Barton, Lamia Joreige, Nicole Brenez, Penny Stempel, Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni, Anand Patwardhan and Sue Clayton in the UK, US, and Europe."
