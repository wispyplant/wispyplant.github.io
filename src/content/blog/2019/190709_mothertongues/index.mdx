title: "Active Online Talk with mother tongues at the Barbican"
description: "I joined Izzy Kroese and The Bonita Chola to present our online curatorial, archival and editorial projects. We discussed multilingualism, digital languages and identity, as well as digital loudness in relation to activism, drawing from own own experiences of working online. We talked about online visibility and fostering safe spaces for communities advocating for POCLGBTQI+ climate justice, trans visibility and intersectional feminism. Our panel discussion was led by mother tongues, which was an interdisciplinary and research-led collective applying decolonial, feminist and queer theory in exploring language and identity."

I joined Izzy Kroese and The Bonita Chola to present our online curatorial, archival and editorial projects. We discussed multilingualism, digital languages and identity, as well as digital loudness in relation to activism, drawing from own own experiences of working online. We talked about online visibility and fostering safe spaces for communities advocating for POCLGBTQI+ climate justice, trans visibility and intersectional feminism. 

Our panel discussion was led by mother tongues, which was an interdisciplinary and research-led collective applying decolonial, feminist and queer theory in exploring language and identity. They ran translation parties at archives and libraries and facilitate workshops engaging with art and language.
