I led a speculative fiction reading session on the first day of Ghost Camp 3, hosted by Anne De Boer + Eloise Bonneviot (The Mycological Twist) + Chaos Magic in Sherwood Forest near Nottingham, the mythical home of Robin Hood. 'Ghost Camps are communal camping moments where participants are invited to reimagine the traditional mythologies around the Left through workshops, readings and screenings.'

"Sherwood - home of the mythical Robin Hood, stealing from the rich to give back to the poor - a testimony to the power of storytelling as a form of resistance. While later iterations added the trope of Mariane and a noble affiliation, its origin speaks of a commoner with disdain for the highborns. The move to ‘tame’ Robin Hood character by painting it as a less controversial figure speaks volumes. The wood as a place where one withdraws from power is another notable character in this folk myth. It is a shelter that functions as an extension to the city. The proximity of the forest with Nottingham allows for a porosity, ideal for Robin Hood’s guerrilla actions. The forest, thus, becomes a political agent intertwined with the fate of Nottingham’s citizens.

In this edition we wanted to look at the woods as a place where mythologies are built and easily imagined. Before Sherwood Forest gained fame through Robin Hood, the vikings used this forest as to meet and hold assemblies. Wandering the same landscape we imagine and explore the way mythological characters emerged from forests and plains, changing their characteristics through day and night."
