title: "The Moon Goddess 嫦娥 (Chang’e) in Mythology, Sci-fi and Lunar Exploration Talk for the Moon Festival at University of Greenwich"
description: "I delivered a talk about The Moon Goddess 嫦娥 (Chang’e), and her space travels through mythology, science fiction and today's lunar exploration programmes. The Chinese Moon Goddess, 嫦娥 (Chang’e), has long-inhabited the Moon and frequents the Earth on various journeys carried by mythologies, science fiction and lunar exploration. At a time when the aspirations of space science compromises Earth’s most vulnerable groups, this talk will ask 'How can we can refocus our lunar stories, inspired by 嫦娥, to move towards a global climate justice'? Margaret Atwood's keynote then followed, to complete the evening programme Maverick Women & the Moon, curated by Irenosen Okojie."

I delivered a talk about The Moon Goddess 嫦娥 (Chang’e), and her space travels through mythology, science fiction and today's lunar exploration programmes. The Chinese Moon Goddess, 嫦娥 (Chang’e), has long-inhabited the Moon and frequents the Earth on various journeys carried by mythologies, science fiction and lunar exploration. At a time when the aspirations of space science compromises Earth’s most vulnerable groups, this talk will ask 'How can we can refocus our lunar stories, inspired by 嫦娥, to move towards a global climate justice'? Margaret Atwood's keynote then followed, to complete the evening programme Maverick Women & the Moon, curated by Irenosen Okojie.

"Throughout history and all across the world, there have always been women who lived at the edge of society. And while they were at it, many have looked to the moon as a source of courage and inspiration. From 15th century European Moon Goddesses all the way to Chinese lunar environmentalists via Afro-Brazilian traditions, Maverick Women and the Moon celebrates the close relationship between the moon and the women who have left and will continue to leave their mark on culture. Curated by Irenosen Okojie."
