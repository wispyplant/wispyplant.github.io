(October 9, 2024 → present) I have been working with the team at INTERPRT – a research agency that pursues environmental justice through spatial and visual investigations – to create an archive of their extensive projects and activities, working also with their web designer towards the new website. 

"The team includes academics, architects and spatial designers with over ten years of experience conducting - investigations on conflict and environmental destruction in various parts of the world. INTERPRT utilises architectural research, 3D reconstructions, remote sensing and various publicly available data to investigate environmental destruction and human rights violations. We undertake long-term investigations on behalf of diverse groups as well as self-initiated research projects for which we produce advocacy videos, interactive maps and evidence files.

INTERPRT collaborates with Climate Counsel, an initiative by former UN lawyers who use their expertise in transnational crime and human rights protection to address the climate emergency. INTERPRT is a member of Investigative Commons, an initiative by Forensic Architecture. We support the global campaign to make ecocide a fifth international crime. Studio INTERPRT is based at the Trondheim Academy of Fine Art (KIT) in the faculty of architecture and design at Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).

We collaborate and cooperate with civil society organizations, international lawyers, scientists, NGOs, journalists and leading cultural institutions worldwide. Some of our past/current collaborators include Forensic Architecture, Stop Ecocide International, Leigh Day, International Foundation Baltasar Garzón (FIBGAR), Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), International Lawyers for West Papua (ILWP), Princeton Science and Global Security, Global Diligence, London Mining Network, Deep Sea Mining Campaign, Office for Contemporary Art (OCA) Norway, Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) Singapore, Biennale Warszawa, Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw and Arts Catalyst."
