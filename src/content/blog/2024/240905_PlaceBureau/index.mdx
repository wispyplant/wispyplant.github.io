My writing on Storytelling Interconnectedness [my workshop series on speculative climate fictions and digital maps] is now published in The Place Bureau's Natural Futures Report. Storytelling Interconnectedness situates climate stories in the real and imaginary: what does it mean to upload speculative fictions as mapped data points? How can we geolocate the uncertainties we feel about our changing environments over time?

"Today, we're excited to launch Natural Futures, a book exploring the evolving relationship between our human spaces and the natural world. In this season of change, we're challenging the outdated notion that humans are separate from nature. Could this be the moment when a more responsive and resilient way of life begins to take root in our cities and countryside?

This project has evolved from modest roots into a truly hefty publication, packed with global case studies and contributions with some of the world's leading natural thinkers. We take you through high level thinking around our existing knowledge systems, down to the most tangible suggestions of small steps we can take towards a more natural future."
