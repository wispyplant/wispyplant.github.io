(March 22, 2024 → March 24, 2024) I was invited back to this programme to be a mentor for a weekend retreat that culminated Ecological Health in Neighbourhoods' 9 month peer-to-peer learning journey for people interested in addressing systemic challenges by creating neighbourhoods that are life-sustaining and provide people and Nature with health, dignity, and justice. I gave a workshop and offered the informal drop-in sessions for participants to discuss with me their ideas relating to creative climate justice. 

Hosted in partnership between Centric Lab, CIVIC SQUARE and Centre For Alternative Technology, the purpose of this collective journey is to create the space and time for communities advocating for justice in their neighbourhoods to imagine, learn, and grow their own ecosystems, frameworks, and practices for healing through non-western epistemologies, data knowledges, and Kinship.
