I was offered a bursary to attend the UKRI BRAID Creative Community Engagement conference for curators to engage with AI research in their practices, organisations and institutions. 

"The AI and the Arts: Who’s Responsible – Artist’s and Curatorial events, happened on 18th and 19th January at the Science Gallery London, developed in partnership with FutureEverything. The events were undertaken as part of the UKRI AHRC BRAID Programme – Inspired Innovation theme, focusing on Responsible AI within the Creative Arts, to coincide with Science Gallery London’s exhibition ‘AI: Who’s Looking After You?’. This was the first in a series of UKRI BRAID Creative Community Engagement events intended to build upon existing networks and strengthen the AI and Arts ecosystem in the UK."
