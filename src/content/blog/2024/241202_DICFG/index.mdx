(December 2, 2024 → December 4, 2024) "Tactical Tech’s Influence Industry Project brought together 35 researchers, artists, journalists, community organisers, and communications professionals from 14 countries at Publix House of Journalism in Berlin for the inaugural Digital Influence and Climate Friction Gathering.   

This Digital Influence and Climate Friction Gathering brought together these cross-disciplinary experts to examine two intersecting challenges:

    - How digital technologies enable and exacerbate false narratives about climate change and influence societal perceptions of the climate crisis.
    - How climate solutions are being actively slowed down by those who profit from maintaining the status quo—what is commonly termed climate friction.

Over three days, participants engaged in presentations, discussions, and open spaces designed to:

    - Identify the key factors driving climate friction and the role of technology in their influence campaigns.
    - Share experiences in countering climate friction, reflecting on which tools and tactics are effective.
    - Explore potential collaborative strategies for the coming years."
