Our forestscapes project has been featured in 'The Critical Forest Studies Collaboratory: A Digital Planting'. 

It includes some words from the collective members on our generative arts methods that are a part of our processes for gathering, using and listening to forest-related sounds. 

"The Critical Forest Studies Collaboratory is convened by Dr David Rousell (RMIT), Professor Wendy Steele (RMIT), Dr Sarah Barns (RMIT), Dr Gideon Boadu (RMIT), Dr Samyia Ambreen (MMU), Dr Cher Hill (Simon Fraser), Professor Johan Siebers (Middlesex University). 

The international Collaboratory situates itself in critical, transdisciplinary studies with forests and treescapes. The Collaboratory looks to seed new connections by bridging fields of research and practice in the environmental humanities, education, and social sciences; environmental arts, regenerative design, and urban planning; and environmental/earth system sciences. We are a vibrant interdisciplinary community with the shared aim of establishing ‘critical forest studies’ as a collective platform for cultivating:

1. new collaborations across the humanities, arts/design, social and natural sciences
2. new reciprocities with diverse stakeholders, institutions, and communities
3. new ways of sharing and circulating knowledge with diverse publics"
