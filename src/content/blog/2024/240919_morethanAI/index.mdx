(July 1, 2024 → September 19, 2024)  I mentored as a 'Sandbox Advisor' to the project groups 'a (re)imitation of life' and 'Glory Mold' through explore their three month R&D, the More Than AI Sandbox, with Pervasive Media Studio. The groups' prototyping journeys explored non-human intelligences, speculative worldbuilding and technology. 

a (re)imitation of life is created by Domenica Landin x Playfool (Daniel Coppen and Saki Maruyama):

Reconnecting AI with non-human perspectives raises essential questions about whose knowledge is shaping the future of this technology and whose knowledge is being overlooked. By revisiting a time when machine intelligence drew inspiration from the natural world, a (re)imitation of life’  is a speculative installation situating AI, represented by an LLM, into an artificial tortoise bodies to explore a non-human perspective on intelligence. By closely integrating the mind, body and environment of an artificial being, this work ultimately aims to decenter the human perspective within AI architecture. It encourages AI to learn from the wisdom of the non-human world, fostering a deeper ecological attunement in the technologies we develop. 


Glory Mold is created by (Produced Moon) and (Studio Areté):

Glory Mold: 2084 is an immersive installation by Produced Moon: a prototype interactive experience set in a speculative sci-fi future where AI development has been entwined and in dialogue with the organic world. Glory Mold is inspired by slime molds – incredible problem solving unicellular organisms that can learn, move and grow with no centralised nervous system. An organism with over 720 sexes that can live for centuries and is deeply sensitive and responsive to its environment.  

This project extends into workshops that invite organisations and individuals to utilise and interrogate the speculative world of Glory Mold as a tool to reflect on their own work and strategize for a more equitable future.
