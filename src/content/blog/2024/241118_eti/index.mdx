(November 18, 2024 → November 22, 2024) I joined the 5-day The Digital Investigation Residency on the “Critical Climates” strand, with other subgroups in the programme relating to “Political Influence” and “AI and Us”. I was able to collaborate with journalists and OSINT investigators to extend my project 'Critiquing a Sustainable Military', which looks at the UK military's climate pledges, to pay attention to wider NATO sustainability intentions. 

The Digital Investigation Residency provided a hugely supportive environment for co-learning investigative strategies, digital methods for research and finding/working with collaborators across the key subjects climate change, technology and the influences for disinformation. 

I have a lot to unpack still, but it was a highlight experience that reaffirmed my direction of work, navigating between the arts and investigations for human and climate rights. 


The event is part of the Collaborative and Investigative Journalism Initiative (CIJI), an EU-funded project carried out in partnership with Tactical Tech, Reporters Without Borders, Free Press Unlimited, Fundacja Reporterów, OBC Transeuropa, and Delfi. CIJI aims to strengthen the collaborative investigations ecosystem through training, learning resources, innovative reporting and networking opportunities.
