(May 20, 2024 → October 31, 2024) I developed a summer programme for KCL students consisting of online and in-person workshops at the Science Gallery to unpack and explore some ideas on food, supply chains and climate change for the global diaspora. 

The activities expanded the politics of consumerism with personal lived experiences of race and cultural heritage when it comes to talking about and enjoying food. I facilitated workshops to create digital mapping as an approach to storytelling across geographies; paper mapping power relations and supply chains, and creative diagram structuring towards a creative zine, which was co-developed with Jo Brinton (GOOD STUDIO). 

There will be final prints on display at the Science Gallery as part of the exhibition [Vital Signs](https://london.sciencegallery.com/vital-signs). 


"This collaborative creative research project considers how the complexity of cultural identity intersects with climate urgency in these changing times. Climate change disrupts food systems by creating fires, floods and droughts which spoil harvests, increase prices and create food scarcity. Across the world, climate change impacting food inaccessibility is disproportionately being felt by global majority and lower income communities.

King’s College London students came together to exchange stories of their personal relationships to food and climate change across borders. Their contributions to the zine share a focus on the injustices of our global food systems, and the long journeys food products make from producer to consumer, rooted in their home contexts of Vietnam, Pakistan and the Caribbean as diaspora in or from London."
