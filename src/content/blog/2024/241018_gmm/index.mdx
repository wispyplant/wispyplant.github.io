I adapted my Weathered Radio workshop (in turn inspired by our forestscapes activities) to deliver a soundscaping tutorial workshop for students of the Global Media Management module 'Critical Media Practices' for the week about sound. 

Shaping the session with an introduction to climate change history and a supported reading list, my prompts related to themes around timelines, places and technologies we 'hear' as part of the landscape of change.
