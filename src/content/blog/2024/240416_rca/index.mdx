During a day of activities for Royal College of Art London students across practice disciplines to engage with ideas for green futures within the institution, I delivered a workshop on climate arts methods and joined an afternoon panel talk where I spoke about the languages of greenwashing in the technology sector. 

This was the inaugural annual day of site specific events, lectures, guided tours, sound experiments and workshops that unites the college through ecological thinking, doing, and making, with the activities making use of the college as an infrastructure for site specific events. 

The symposium was organised by Dr Sally O'Reilly, Associate Lecturer, Writing programme & UCU Environment Officer and Dr Jesse Ash, Tutor in painting.
