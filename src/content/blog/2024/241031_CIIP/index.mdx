"Angela YT Chan is an independent researcher, data engineer and artist specialising in climate change.In her talk she will introduce key themes across her practice that focuses on how climate change narratives in the public domain relate to colonial histories, technologies and justice. She will share creative digital methodologies in her critical research and interdisciplinary collaborations through highlighted projects. These include “forestscapes”, a collective inquiry into forest and ecological restoration with generative arts and sound materials with Public Data Lab (KCL), and her independent research-arts practice with current projects “Critiquing a ‘sustainable military’” and “The Colonial History of Climate Tech” (supported by Tactical Tech and Heritage for Global Challenges Research Centre respectively)."
