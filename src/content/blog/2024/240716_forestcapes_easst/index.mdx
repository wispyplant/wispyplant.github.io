We held a forestscapes soundscaping workshop to STS researchers at EASST-4S 2024 in Amsterdam.

From the conference programme: 

    "Facilitators: Jonathan W. Y. Gray (King’s College London), Angela Y. T. Chan (Independent), Maud Borie (King’s College London), Andrés Saenz de Sicilia (Northeastern University London), Liliana Bounegru (King’s College London)

    This hands-on workshop invites participants to explore how arts-based digital methods for recomposing collections of sound and video may support collective inquiry into forests as living cultural landscapes, ecological issues and the politics of ecosystem restoration.

    How can recomposing sound and video support situating, materialising and pluralising forest relations? This workshop aims to support participants in exploring arts-based digital methods for recomposing collections of sound and video to support “collective inquiry” into forests as living cultural landscapes, ecological issues and the politics of ecosystem restoration.

    The workshop will introduce methods for recomposing sound and video, drawing on the forestscapes project as well as associated forest media collaborations with the Critical Zones exhibition (ZKM), the School for Poetic Computation and a 12-country EU forest and ecological restoration project. It will support participants in making small sound and video compositions using a variety of free and open source tools (e.g. supercollider, videogrep, ffmpeg).

    The workshop will conclude with sharing works and reflection on how such art-based methods and approaches might support engaged STS research and interventions.

    No prior background in arts-based or digital methods is needed to participate."
