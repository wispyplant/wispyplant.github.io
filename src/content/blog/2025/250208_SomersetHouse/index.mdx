"Join us for a collective soundscape making/listening workshop with Angela YT Chan. Together we will be exploring the depths and breadths of soil, its history, and its endless possibilities. 

Participants will be invited to submit up to two sound or image files of soil. Detailed instructions will be provided by email upon registration. The sounds and images will then be discussed in the workshop and compiled into a speculative audiovisual collage."
