With the Green Screen Climate Justice & Digital Rights Coalition and Oxford University, I delivered a talk and workshop on green militarism. The participants included gathered academic researchers, policymakers and civil society groups from Europe, the US and East Asia, and our wider day's activities encouraged participants to learn about Taiwanâ€™s climate and geopolitical context and broader issues related to the environmental impacts of AI.
