I join artists [Sue Palmer](https://inquilines.com/) and [Sheila Ghelani](https://www.sheilaghelani.co.uk/) at Radar, LU Arts at Loughborough University, "as they turn over the interconnections between climate and geology, fuel and feelings, the strata and layers of atmospheres through performance and action." 

After the performance, I will be in conversation with geoscientist Dr Josh Wolstenholme, and we will respond to the artists' topics as their invited guests.

Sue and Sheila have previously collaborated on Common Salt, a show and tell about empire, nature and memory, and this new piece builds on their practice and performance work.
