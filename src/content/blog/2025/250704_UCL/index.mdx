I will lead a locket making workshop to playfully consider research as a practice for memory making and archiving for the future. It will prompt a refocusing of research, in a time of global uncertainties and polarities, as a channel to nurture hope. I will also deliver a presentation and join a panel talk with other ambassadors to discuss the symposium's key questions on speculation and research.

From the programme: 

"Speculative Worlds Research Collective (SWRC) have been working with ‘speculation’ as a concept in academia by bringing together artists and researchers. From these activities, what has emerged is that speculation is a nebulous concept which merits closer examination.

For this year's Summer Lab, we are hosting a symposium to explore the multiple interpretations of the concept 'speculation'. The What is Speculation? Symposium brings together researchers and artists to discuss the concept, what it means in particular contexts, and to express the thinking of speculation in their world. The Symposium includes a panel discussion and participative creative exercises to provoke thinking with speculation through application. Finally, we will be hosting a Long Lunch on Speculation to stimulate discussion followed by refreshments and a networking social.

This event is generously funded by UCL's Institute for Advanced Studies Octagon Small Grants Fund.
