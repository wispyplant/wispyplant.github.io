I led an iteration of my Weathered Radio ecological sound workshop (closed: speakers and ICF PGRs and staff only) and gave a presentation on forestscapes' methodologies with sound, and my research into climate and conflict during a panel with Spyros Bofylatos, Harun Morrison and Christie Swallow.

From the programme description: 

"The recent embrace of perspectives and practices traditionally overlooked within art and design’s canons, from the pluriverse to the more-than-human, has transpired in a redress of alterity and of subjectivity. Perhaps ironically, the outward expansion of creative and critical enquiry has necessitated an increasingly inward-looking gaze. This symposium will consider the convergence of more-than-human interfaces – including both multispecies and technological – and auto-ethnographic methods within current research and creative practice.    

We will consider the following questions:   

- Where are the boundaries between the individual and the other-than-human, when we are porous and entangled bodies, each containing multitudes?  

- How do we look inward to look outward, navigating the terrain of the self without succumbing to navel-gazing?    

- What potential does autotheory present for collective and multispecies liberation?    

- Which methods can bring a focus to the radical otherness of species difference without sidelining social marginalisation and inequality?   

- Within the interface of self and more-than-human, what is the potential for agency and what are the limits of empathy?"
