I supported the workshop organisers by moderating a participant subgroup through the workshop activities. 

"Taiwan in particular is a site of resistance and violence, where communities have been challenging the electronic pollution and the expansion of Taiwan’s Science Parks since 1990, as well as military supply chains within which the semiconductor industry is situated. Holding this solidarity space at RightsCon 2025 is crucial. What other geographies are implicated in this matrix of technology, militarism, and environment?  Both movements, environmental justice and anti-militarism, are not new. However, the scale of the problem has skyrocketed in the aftermath of semi-conductors supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID pandemic, as well as the expansion of AI and military technologies tragically exemplified by Israel’s genocide in Gaza and the war in Ukraine.  Existing local struggles connect to a cross-border story that traces supply chains and outlines imperialist and military aims of the US, China, Russia, and others. 

In this session, we will bring Taiwan, Okinawa, Serbia, DRC, US, and Latin American based organisations and individuals working at the intersections of technology, militarism, and environment, to ask: Which interventions should we direct our attention towards, such that false claims of “security” and “sustainability” of technology supply chains do not lead to further ecocide and military aggression?  How do we interrupt these systems and engage in trans-territorial solidarity? In answering these questions, we will make explicit links between sites of violence/extraction and between communities of resistance - co-creating resources including a power map, library of tactics, and seed a cross-territorial network.
