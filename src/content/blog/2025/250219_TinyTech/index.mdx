"Join us for an evening of online participatory learning and sharing hosted by Arts Catalyst and Dani Admiss and led by artists Maya Chowdhry, Manual Labours (Sophie Hope and Jenny Richards) and Angela YT Chan x Bóxī Wú. 

In an online ‘night school’, we are inviting others to share in our learning and participate in our programme in experiential ways.
 
Audience members will have the choice of whether to join Angela YT Chan x Bóxī Wú explore low-tech solutions to sustain life and community against big tech; create a musical score with Maya Chowdhry and learn how to nudge our community whilst letting people go their own way; and hear from Manual Labours with their perspectival shifting experiment ‘Toilet Breaks’ helping us to reimagine and reorganising rest and work in the arts.
  
Following this, we will all come together for a reflective discussion, and to learn about three imaginative learning resources that have been designed by Public Tactics (flematu sessay) who will share their process and tips."
