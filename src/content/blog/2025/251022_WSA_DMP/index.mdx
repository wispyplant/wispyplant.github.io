I delivered a lecture introducing environmental issues relating to digital media infrastructures, titled 'Computing Infrastructures: Climate Justice Through Digital Media'. The students were on the MA Digital Media, in the Department of Art and Media Technology, at Winchester School of Art. 

The lecture was arranged in three parts: 1) an introduction to climate justice, 2) digital media 
and carbon and 3) what a just future for technology in light of climate change could look like. 

My lecture description is as follows: 

"As the tech sector narrates solutions to climate change through continued modes of extraction on people and the planet, a combined justice movement that connects climate and technological impacts is necessary. 
 
In this session, we will explore insights into how some digital media practices extend our understandings of the environment around us as climate change continues to exacerbate social injustices. In particular, we will look to how practitioners uncover the history of technology's role in extractivism, how multispecies and speculative fiction approaches are applied to digital media practices, and how to go beyond only the metrics of carbon emissions of digital media."
