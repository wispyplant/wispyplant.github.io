For the Sunlight Liberation Network (SLN), I invited researcher, educator and community organiser Bóxī Wú to collaborate with me to explore further our mutual interests and concerns around the environmental impacts of technological progress. 

We brought a community of specialised participants together online in ‘Tiny Tech Futures' as a workshop to discuss and design how low-tech and self-hosted technologies can play a role in lighter and greener creative practice.

A visual documentation of the session was created by Public Tactics and is viewable [here](https://artscatalyst.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Tiny-Tech-Futures_FD-1.pdf  )

"Sunlight Liberation Network (SLN) is an art and climate justice network made up of artists, art workers and their communities. We support and share peer learning and imaginative action, so more of us can redirect our energies away from the extractive everyday toward building better tomorrows. 

Our second edition, ‘Tending Waste, Cultivating Life’, is a collaboration with Arts Catalyst. Across three workshops in January 2025, artists Angela YT Chan, Maya Chowdhry, Manual Labours (Sophie Hope & Jenny Richards), Bóxī Wú, and designer Public Tactics (flematu sessay), will work with Sheffield-based art and grassroots organisations, as well as art workers, residents and agitators, to explore imaginative, tangible and action-based approaches to tending waste from the vantage points of food, labour, and technology."
