Re:Assemble is a peer learning gathering to build our collective capacity and resilience through connection, collaboration and exchange at a time of increasing pressure and compounding crises, hosted at Centre For Alternative Technology in Machynlleth, Wales.

After 5 years of open learning journeys alongside Doughnut Economics Action Lab, Centric Lab, Material Cultures, Dark Matter Labs, Fircroft College and more, this gathering brings together peers from Doughnut Economics, Ecological Health in Neighbourhoods, Material Matter[s] and Re:Builders Learning Journeys to further connect and resource this growing ecosystem of practitioners and organisers working towards regenerative futures at the scale of the home, street and neighbourhood.


"Through a rich programme of talks, discussions, workshops, co-builds, screenings, performances, movement, and more—including a bounty of peer-led sessions alongside invited guests to expand our collective thinking—we will share learning and explore practice for organising together in a way that is commensurate with the scale of the challenges and opportunities we face socially and ecologically at local and global scales.

We're excited to be joined by Alys Fowler, Angela YT Chan, Black Rootz, Centric Lab, Coffee Afrik, Criw Compostio, Dark Matter Labs, Generous Waste, East Marsh United, Indra Adnan, Island City Lab, Kate Raworth, Louna Sbou, Material Cultures, Materials In Mind, People Dem Collective, Portland Inn Project, recollective, Social Designs, WeCanMake, and many more who you can expect to hear from.

Nestled in the mountains of Snowdonia, the Centre For Alternative Technology (CAT) has been at the forefront of experimenting, creating, and implementing practical solutions for sustainability for 40 years. The CAT site is home to multiple examples and exhibits that explore renewable energy, insulation, composting, local growing, water management and more."
