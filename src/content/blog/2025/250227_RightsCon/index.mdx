"While much needed, digital infrastructures are often extractive infrastructures: they reinforce colonialism, capitalism, the military industrial complex, and the climate crisis. In this dialogue, we want to explore narratives around digital infrastructures. Who is developing and promoting narratives about infrastructures? What do these narratives imply? What public-private and geopolitical interests do these entities reflect? What role(s) do crises play? Which infrastructures remain invisible or unseen – and why?  

Through concrete cases, such as the narrative of the European ‘twin transition’ of sustainability and digitization, the UN’s promotion of ‘AI for good’ and differing notions of ‘technological sovereignty’, we will explore how digital infrastructures are tied to extractivism. In this exploratory dialogue, we want to take the time and space to unpack these narratives about extractive infrastructures from different disciplinary perspectives and create a more multifaceted understanding of these notions  Most importantly, we aim to put forward ideas for how digital infrastructures can be built with more just models of governance, away from capitalist, colonialist and military interests, based on feminist action and rooted in community needs and practices. Can digital infrastructures facilitate solidarity across movements and borders?  

Speakers include: Andreea Belu (Head of Campaigns & Comms, EDRi), Angela YT Chan (artist and independent researcher), Camila Nobrega (Beyond the Green, Associate Researcher at the Technische Universität Dresden — TU Dresden), Michelle Thorne(Green Web Foundation)."
