In this talk, I and Nella Arne (Obsidian Coast) represented the Hypericum Working Group and introduced the Hypericum: A Code of Practice, a long-term research project developing a collectively produced, ever-evolving code of practice for feminist, antiracist, anticolonial and environmentally sustainable arts organising. 

"The project is currently led by a Working Group of UK based arts workers and small-scale organisations: Angela Chan, Divya Osbon, Anjali Prashar-Savoie, Jamila Prowse, la Sala and Obsidian Coast. Bringing together existing knowledge that already informs creative and community organising practices across different contexts and communities, Hypericum envisions arts organising practices that centre care, generosity, solidarity and sustainability, and dismantle hetero/cissexist patriarchy, white supremacy, ableism, capitalist extraction and accelerated production. The first draft of the Code of Practice will be shared as an online platform in 2021."
