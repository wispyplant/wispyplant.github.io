For MAIA's The Spatial Imagination, gathering practitioners and ideas at the intersection of art, culture, design and spatial practice, I joined the panel talk with Kaajal Modi, Auden Allen, Farah Ahmed, Tianna Johnson and Rebekah Ubuntu, each sharing our creative, community-focused work. 

"The Spatial Imagination channeled the abundance of ideas, passion, excitement and work of those at the intersection of art, culture, design and spatial practice."

"MAIAâ€™s vision is a world towards liberation, in which artists are resourced and mobilised to reimagine its possibilities.
Our mission is to grow capacity for collective world-building, where Black imagination and culture are lenses to explore how we get free."
