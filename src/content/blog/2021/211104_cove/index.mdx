(November 4, 2021 → November 7, 2021) On the occasion of UNCOP26, Cove Park launched its first and permanent enquiry focused on the environmental crisis and the radical change that our collective intelligence can affect in terms of climate action. As part of this initiation, I delivered an artist talk about my practice, touching on my methods with climate colonialism and collaborative counternarrative projects. I also attended other researchers' presentations and workshops. 

"‘Turbulence / Emergence / Enchantment: A Compendium of Climate Literacies’ takes place at Cove Park between 4-7 November 2021 and is organised in partnership with the Centre for Ancient Environmental Studies and Professor Jason König at the University of St Andrews, London-based curator Lucia Pietroiusti, TBA21-Academy and Markus Reymann, and the School of Classics and the College of Arts and Humanities (Environmental Humanities Research Strand) of University College Dublin and Dr. Giacomo Savani. The symposium is made possible by funding from Arts & Business Scotland: Culture & Business Fund."
