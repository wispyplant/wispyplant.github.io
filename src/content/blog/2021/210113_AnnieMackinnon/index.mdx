I was interviewed by Annie Mackinnon for her publication on 'investigating Industry 4.0’s intersections with political ecology, social justice and sustainability both within the Fashion Industry'. In my contribution, I spoke about my use speculative fiction as an approach to global climate change issues and how I engage with issues of justice through history in my artistic practice. 

"‘A Plastiglomerate Rock Dreams it were a Beautiful Fossil’ is the first publication in a project investigating Industry 4.0’s intersections with political ecology, social justice and sustainability both within the Fashion Industry, and broader design and creative fields. In the form of writing, interviews, video and narrative artefacts, the project engages in both speculative practises and industry research to examine technology’s role in both positive change, as well as disruption, control and power." 

"Featuring interviews with Angela Chan, Brooke Roberts-Islam, Florence Okoye, Jessica Graves, Orsola de Castro, Sam Chester and Xiaowei Wang.
Interviews conducted between November 2020 to April 2021."
