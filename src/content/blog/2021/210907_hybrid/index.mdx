(September 7, 2021 → October 5, 2021) What is the new normal? How can virtual communication reinforce communities and real-world interaction? By the invite of Thea Behrman, I joined the Hybrid Space workshops, which convened a diverse group of creative and social practitioners in different places around the UK to make real world connections. Hybrid Space is an Arts Council England-funded engagement programme by community arts organisation 2NQ which sought to learn from previous experiences of redesigning events during lockdown. We met almost weekly with group sharings and discussions on health, food, systems, neighbourhoods and climate change. 

Participants of Hybrid Space were: Sefryn Penrose, Lora Aziz, Marley, Rian Hughes, Professor Brian Cox, Lauralee Whyte, Safa Diab, Johanne Hudson-Lett, Julia Udall, Sallie Fellowes, Michael Sanders, Harriet Leyland, David Blandy, Mona Arshi, and Franca Addyman. The programme was organised by Malcolm Garrett, Thea Behrman, Simon Poulter, and Kasper de Graaf. 

It was supported by 2NQ, a programme delivered by The Agency of Citizens, a not-for-profit organisation developing arts, cultural and heritage programmes with local communities. 

"Hybrid Space is an Arts Council England-funded engagement programme by community arts organisation 2NQ which sought to learn from previous experiences of redesigning events during lockdown. The programme included Art School in a Box, a series of hybrid art sessions with vulnerable adults in partnership with MIND Islington, and the Hybrid Space workshops which convened a diverse group of creative and social practitioners in different places around the UK to make real world connections."
