title: "Water Framings - Nourishment: A Cyclical Programme Artist Residency at Primary in Nottingham"
description: "As part of Nourishment: A Cyclical Programme, I spent a week in Nottingham as Primary's artist in resident. I continued my research into water and kinds of communal stories about the environment have been told throughout the recent history in the city. I visited the archives at The Manuscripts and Special Collections at University of Nottingham Libraries, reviewing and gathering insights on water related campaigns by local authorities, water and sewage companies and residents. The residency gave me time to develop further questions on UK public framings of environmental issues for future projects. (October 25, 2021 → October 31, 2021)"

(October 25, 2021 → October 31, 2021) As part of Nourishment: A Cyclical Programme, I spent a week in Nottingham as Primary's artist in resident. I continued my research into water and kinds of communal stories about the environment have been told throughout the recent history in the city. I visited the archives at The Manuscripts and Special Collections at University of Nottingham Libraries, reviewing and gathering insights on water related campaigns by local authorities, water and sewage companies and residents. The residency gave me time to develop further questions on UK public framings of environmental issues for future projects. 

"Angela will spend the residency continuing her work on water, people and power in relation to climate change. She will consider how water shapes the city, from its natural landscape, the waterways industrial history, and everyday community resilience to the social and ecological impacts today. Thinking about the processes that enable the water cycle to renew and repeat, she’ll ask how this model of adaptation can inform our own human processes with the environment. What happens when cycles are disrupted, and how they can be strengthened?"
