I had the joy of inviting members of Struggles for Sovereignty: Land, Water, Farming, Food (SFS) - a Yogyakarta-based a collective platform focusing on the intersections of social and ecological justice - to discuss with me how we reach our intentions towards international solidarities through creative, people-centred projects. The topics include intersectional, intercontinental ecological activism through collective, land-based engagements. On the call were four of the ten members of SFS, which is a union of two groups - Elia Nurvista, Lista Handitya (Bakudapan Food Study Group ) and Sanne Oorthuizen and Alec Steadman (Bodies of Power /Power for Bodies). 

VirtuallyReality:
"Our SS21 season titled 'The Long Triumph' addresses the knowing sprawl of a world we have machinicly shaped, and how we could rethink our worldly engagements during and after times of emergency. We see you featuring in a programme themed around 'symbiosis for survival' between 12th-18th July; how might we - in the face of a mass extinction event - recalibrate our relationship with the planet, other species and each other in order to survive."


Struggles for Sovereignty:
"Struggles for Sovereignty: Land, Water, Farming, Food (SFS) is a collective platform focusing on the intersections of social & ecological justice, organised by Bodies of Power / Power for Bodies and Bakudapan Food Study Group, based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We develop programs both online and offline that bring together communities working from the fields of art, food, farming, land rights, indigenous (“adat”) and ecological activism to share their work and contexts with each other and the public. Through our programs, we aim to build lasting solidarity between groups in Indonesia and around the world who are engaged with struggles for the right to self-determination over the basic resources that our individual and collective bodies need."
