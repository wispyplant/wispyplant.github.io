title: "Ecological Thinking: Radar Visiting Artist at LU Arts"
description: "I joined the 2021/2022 residency cohort for Ecological Thinking at Radar, LU Arts based at Loughborough University. For the programme of artist commissions and events exploring what creative and collaborative methodologies can bring to ecological study, the residency programme works with the University's emerging interdisciplinary Environmental Humanities network. My residency focused on the Arjun Appadurai's concept of the 'right to research' as a starting point what I see as a need to deconstruct the criteria for expertise for climate issues. (November 24, 2021 → May 30, 2022)"

"Radar is Loughborough University's contemporary arts research programme, and forms part of LU Arts. We invite artists to produce new work in response to, alongside and in provocation of research undertaken across Loughborough University’s two campuses. We also programme events bringing together artistic and academic work. The work we commission is process-led, frequently participatory, and often takes place in the public realm, including across our campuses."
