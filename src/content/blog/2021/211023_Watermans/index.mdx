For the Season of Change programme, Watermans Art Centre held a day symposium about climate arts and creative provocations. I gave a pre-recorded talk with prompts for critical engagements on the topics of climate justice and resourcing creative activities by minoritised artists. 

"Part of Season for Change, a nationwide programme of artistic and cultural events that celebrate the environment and inspire urgent climate action led by Artsadmin and Julieâ€™s Bicycle, and supported by Arts Council England and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation.

Connected Nature was an exhibition presented at Watermans  between 1 October 2021 and 20 February 2022 as part of the New Media Art programme."
