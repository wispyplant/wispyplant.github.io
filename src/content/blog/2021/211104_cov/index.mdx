title: "Beyond the Anthropocene Talk with The Parallel State for Coventry Biennial"
description: "The Parallel State is a space for collective reimagination of how to self-govern and flourish. It asks: What does the landscape look like in the Parallel State and what new epoch has emerged in a more equitable, de-colonised, post-capitalist world where humans are harmoniously entangled with nature? In my sharing, I explored how our power relations with the water cycle shapes our perceptions, stories and material resources. I also joined other guest speakers, Jo Capper, Youngsook Choi, Anna Hints, Jason Singh and Rachel Bower, in a group discussion.  "

The Parallel State is a space for collective reimagination of how to self-govern and flourish. It asks: What does the landscape look like in the Parallel State and what new epoch has emerged in a more equitable, de-colonised, post-capitalist world where humans are harmoniously entangled with nature? In my sharing, I explored how our power relations with the water cycle shapes our perceptions, stories and material resources. I also joined other guest speakers, Jo Capper, Youngsook Choi, Anna Hints, Jason Singh and Rachel Bower, in a group discussion. 

"The Parallel State is a breakaway state – a space to collectively imagine alternative solutions to life on earth – free from the oppositional constraints of the failed states in which we live. The Parallel State is building new alliances through a series of events, laying the foundations for a Parallel State Summit.

At this online event the Parallel State will be asking:

What does the landscape look like in the Parallel State and what new epoch has emerged in a more equitable, de-colonised, post-capitalist world where humans are harmoniously entangled with nature?" 

"Coventry Biennial is the UKs social biennial. Committed to inclusivity, accessibility, diversity, comfort and making things together. Coventry Biennial is about walking and eating together, its about a commitment to society, its about a personable and non-institutional approach to existing in the world.

Coventry Biennial supports and presents socially, politically and critically engaged artistic practices in Coventry and Warwickshire to local, national and international audiences.

Founded in 2017 as an artist-led and strategic response to the city publishing its 10 year cultural strategy and bidding to become UK City of Culture, Coventry Biennial is an activist organisation which responds to the city’s complex history, geography, built environment and relationships but retains an outward looking perspective, ensuring that the programme has wider appeal, significance and impact."
