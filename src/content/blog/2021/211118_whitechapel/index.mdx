"What is earth? This interdisciplinary panel explores the political, cultural and social meanings of earth from a variety of distinct perspectives: as commodity, as matter, and as sustenance. Chaired by artist and curator Angela YT Chan, with special guest speakers including organic grower and writer Claire Ratinon, Professor of Inhuman Geography at Queen Mary Kathryn Yusoff and artist Phoebe Collings-James, we consider powerful and creative ways of re-imagining earth and land.
