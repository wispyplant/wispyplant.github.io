(April 1, 2021 â†’ April 30, 2021) I was selected to join the inaugural OVEREXPOSED Residency with Sonic Acts, which focused on creatively researching on the theme of pollution. For my one-month residency project, I continued my work into military history and began researching the effects of tear gas in the water system, namely the literature surrounding recent urban protests in relation to Hong Kong pro-democracy and the Black Lives Matter movements. 

"Sonic Acts is proud to announce six artists and researchers for the OVEREXPOSED home-based residency.

OVEREXPOSED is the new residency programme from Sonic Acts investigating pollution and its effects on everything living and non-living. In response to the Open Call, we received almost 400 applications including many imaginative and compelling perspectives on the core questions underlying the programme. 

As a result of the quality and breadth of the applications, we have doubled the number of residents to six. Each resident will undertake a one-month period of remote artistic research between December 2020 and May 2021. Stay tuned for updates on their practice and developments!

The resident artists and researchers are Ameneh Solati, Angela YT Chan, Arjuna Neuman, Devin Hentz, Maryam Monalisa Gharavi, and MELT."
