title: "Design, Ecology and the Commons Talk for Techne Student Congress: Back to the Future, Loughborough University London"
description: "As part of the third conference day, I spoke about how the lived experiences of climate and environmental changes for minoritised communities are often counternarratives to mainstream climate stories, and that a 'commoning' of this space could shape a closer solution to being positive change. I was also in conversation with the other guest speakers Torange Khonsari , Justin Sacks and Maurizio Teli, with Pandora Syperek moderating our session. "

As part of the third conference day, I spoke about how the lived experiences of climate and environmental changes for minoritised communities are often counternarratives to mainstream climate stories, and that a 'commoning' of this space could shape a closer solution to being positive change. I was also in conversation with the other guest speakers Torange Khonsari , Justin Sacks and Maurizio Teli, with Pandora Syperek moderating our session. 

"At the onset of the COVID crisis, new commons emerged that constituted critical responses to frontline struggles in crucial and urgent ways – through the formation of solidarity networks, knowledge commons to support mutual aid and community groups who acted to reclaim decaying public spaces in the face of physical distance measures. At the same time, concepts, practices and visions of commons are not beyond reproach and instances of malpractice as well as reification, risk jeopardising practices and possibilities thereof. Conceiving the commons as a shared collective practice, this panel will focus on these issues and debates to unravel the relevance of commons today, through the lens of design."

​
"The theme of the conference is the question of ‘Back to the Future’. The pandemic has affected our lives and livelihoods in previously unimaginable ways. It has had profound effects on the cultural and creative industries and highlighted issues of equality, diversity and inclusion. What are our post pandemic aspirations? What can we learn from our recent and distant pasts? How can we create a better future? This theme is built around the idea of returning to thinking about the future, as we emerge from and come to terms with, the pandemic and its effects. 

This conference is organised by Techne (AHRC Doctoral Training Partnership) in conjunction with Loughborough University London."
