I co-facilitated a 'dreamscape' workshop with [Ntando Cele](https://ntandocele.com/), a director, performer, and theatre maker based in Bern. With a small, closed group of artists and activists of the Global Majority, this workshop explored eco-feminist approaches for hope, connection and intersectionality. Our activities discussed the ancestral knowledge we practice in our everyday lives and what opportunities we saw for culture to solve climate change from our lived experiences. 

De-Cology: Walking in Our Mothers’ Gardens was supported by Complicité in collaboration with Pro Helvetia, through the Swiss Selection Edinburgh programme.
