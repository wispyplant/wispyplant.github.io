I contributed to the first entry of the lexicon for In, From, and With: Exploring Collaborative Survival Book which has a preface by Anna Tsing. My piece, 'A: Assemblage', takes mosses as an inspiration to explore methods of holding hydration, gentleness and orientation.

'In, From, and With: Exploring Collaborative Survival is a collectively constructed lexicon that collates a series of terms selected by twenty-four contributors, ranging from botanists to artists to agricultural producers and more. The interactive book, including edible and non-edible recipes, explores the notion of collaborative survival through a series of sensorial pedagogies, implementing the body as a fulcrum for digesting terminology. In, From, and With romances the possibility of reading and doing as a means of metabolizing, braiding together practice and pedagogy through an intimate inquiry of contemporary consumption.
