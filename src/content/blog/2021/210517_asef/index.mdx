I wrote about my artistic and curatorial practices that specialise in climate change, and climate history in particular, as a featured artist profile in ASEF culture360 and Invisible Flock's new Green Guide for the United Kingdom - the 8th in the series Creative Responses to Sustainability around the world. 

"Creative Responses to Sustainability is a series of country-specific guides published by culture360 since 2015. Each guide provides an overview of the most pioneering artists and arts organisations addressing issues of sustainability in their artistic practice.  

The latest Green Guide for the United Kingdom researched by Invisible Flock collects commissioned creative responses, articles and a series of over 30 conversations with artists, collectives and organisations based in the UK whose core practice is grounded in sustainable, ecological, environmental and/or climate based understandings. It looks to unravel a breadth of approaches to explore the challenges we all face making work in this field. It is intended as a patchwork of stories and practices that look to understand how a creative practice allows us to explore the immense complexities of our time."
