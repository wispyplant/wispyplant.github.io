â€œAs a player, you are both the creator and spectator of the narrative.

The Mycological Twist activates their installation Reverse Synergy (2021) by inviting artists, academics, and visitors to participate, reflect and live with them in the online multi-player game ECO from Strange Loop Games. One group will act as caretakers for the two months of the exhibition, and another group will be giving presentations, in game, during three live events. Through this long game experience, the players will explore the different perspectives of (online) co-existence and the alternative aspects of the dynamics of digital communities and gaming culture."
