I wrote a piece of short fiction that takes us to a near future in which pandemic time blurs world politics. I respond to the governments increased spending in defence, in contrast to its reluctance to maintain free school meals for children in poverty during the lockdowns. It was commissioned by The Alternative School of Economics (Ruth Beale & Amy Feneck), who created a free digital publication called The End of the Present to mark the end of their residency at Arts Catalyst.
