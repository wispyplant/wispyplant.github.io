I delivered a workshop that introduced climate history concepts through my selected artefacts from Barber's collection, including print, sculpture and painting. It aimed to use art history as a frame to connect local and global environmental changes over the years, critically discussing power across geographies and collections. 

"The Barber team have invited Angela Chan of curatorial project Worm Art + Ecology to investigate climate and environmental issues throughout art history and in the Barber’s own collection. Angela will host a guided workshop on how we might view and discuss painting, sculpture and prints through the lens of environmental research and global histories. This will be done through presentation and open discussion as a group. Together we’ll develop expressive and analytical skills to narrate the local and global histories of people, power and the environment, and talk about how these experiences have shaped today’s climate issues.
