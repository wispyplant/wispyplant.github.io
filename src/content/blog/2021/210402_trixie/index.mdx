description: "I was commissioned by Alice dos Reis to write an accompanying text for their solo exhibition at Trixie in The Hague. Resonating with the themes of finding belonging, learning about and through other species, and feeling the spaciousness that exists in, between and beyond the Earth's various landscapes, I wrote a speculative fiction, with humour, from the perspectives of the krill that the protagonist bioengineer experiments on, in Alice's own sf narrative in their film that was on exhibition. My text was exhibitied on Trixie's exterior window for pedestrian viewing. (April 2, 2021 → April 25, 2021)"

(April 2, 2021 → April 25, 2021) I was commissioned by Alice dos Reis to write an accompanying text for their solo exhibition at Trixie in The Hague. Resonating with the themes of finding belonging, learning about and through other species, and feeling the spaciousness that exists in, between and beyond the Earth's various landscapes, I wrote a speculative fiction, with humour, from the perspectives of the krill that the protagonist bioengineer experiments on, in Alice's own sf narrative in their film that was on exhibition. My text was exhibitied on Trixie's exterior window for pedestrian viewing. 

"under a two-moon belief system no duality endures brings together two recent film works by Alice dos Reis in her first solo exhibition in the Netherlands. While Undercurrent follows a marine biologist as she maps out the bottom of the Atlantic by remote sensing with bioengineered krill, Stan Rehearsal looks at a group of friends from the Atlantic island of São Miguel, who witness the archipelago’s first rocket launch. Both these speculative fiction films connect through a vertical axis: from the bottom of the ocean to outer space, its characters navigate questions regarding the more-than-human and the systems that mediate their contact."
