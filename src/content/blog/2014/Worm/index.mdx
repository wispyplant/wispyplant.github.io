description: "Over 7 years, I independently produced a long-term curatorial project called Worm: art + ecology. It focused on communicating climate change justice issues through contemporary art and creative practices. I produced 5 international exhibitions under the name Worm: art + ecology, and regularly published interviews with practitioners on the website. I directly commissioned 53 artists worldwide for collaboration with project funding. When I began to deliver public workshops and talks in person, I gradually started to work under my own name, Angela YT Chan, and forming an artistic practice. (October 1, 2014 → December 31, 2021)"

For over 7 years (October 1, 2014 → December 31, 2021), I independently produced a long-term curatorial project called Worm: art + ecology. It focused on communicating climate change justice issues through contemporary art and creative practices. 

I produced 5 international exhibitions under the name Worm: art + ecology, and regularly published interviews with practitioners on the website. I directly commissioned 53 artists worldwide for collaboration, by gaining and managing project funding from funders Arts Council England, Mondriaan Fund, Het Nieuwe Instituut, Gemeente Rotterdam, Stichting Bevordering van Volkskracht, MAMA, and Arts Council Norway.  

When I began to deliver public workshops and talks in person, I gradually started to work under my own name, Angela YT Chan, and forming an artistic practice.
