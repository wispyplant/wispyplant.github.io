As part of the public programme that runs beside the art fair alternative titled 'In Watermelon Sugar', I delivered a talk on Decolonising Art and Environmentalism with examples of my curatorial practice. The talk was held at the former Atelier Coppens, and in its 7th edition, the programme's thematic focus was on creative world-making beyond the anthroprocene and petrocapitalism. 

"Poppositions is an 'annual assembly in Brussels of galleries, artist initiatives and project spaces', which will be hosted at the former Atelier Coppens. Curated by Niekolaas Johannes Lekkerkerk."
