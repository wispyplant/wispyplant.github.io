"The ICA launched its first MA in partnership with the University of Kent in September 2013. The MA in the Contemporary is an interdisciplinary programme in the field of contemporary culture that gives students the opportunity to pick modules from a wide variety of disciplines across contemporary practice including: Literature, Creative Writing, Film, Drama, and History and Philosophy of Art.

Addressing key themes and issues in contemporary thinking and practice, students gain a deep understanding of the relationship between disciplines in the arts and an appreciation of the way in which interdisciplinary thinking makes it possible to grasp and respond to key issues in contemporary culture.

Co-taught by staff from the School of English, School of Music and Fine Art and School of Arts at the University of Kent and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, the seminars take place at both the Canterbury campus and at the ICA on the Mall.

‘Reading the Contemporary’ is the first module on the programme."
