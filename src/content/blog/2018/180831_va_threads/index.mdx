I joined a series of speakers on a relay-style panel talk to discuss how racial justice informs our work. 

"Speakers from the arts, activism and beyond share the ways their heritage inspires their current practice. From journalism to curation, this relay style talk features rolling two-person conversations lasting 10 minutes each. Featuring Angela YT Chan, Bridget Minamore, Eric Lau, Gameli Ladzekpo, Kaia Charles, Kieran Yates, Nasreen Shaikh Jamal al lail, Yewande Odunubi, Yomi Adegoke and Zing Tsjeng. Black and Asian histories are a vital part of Britain’s fabric. How are these voices recorded and remembered today? Join us this Friday Late as we reframe the archive and put untold histories on the map. See dancers explore hybrid identities and hear poets recount stories of inheritance. From improvised music to independent publishing, celebrate those claiming space and building new communities on the foundations of heritage.
A collaboration between Historic England and the V&A."
