title: "Knowledge Sharing, Care (Towards Self, Community and Ecologies) and Social Justice Talk In formation III : Embodied Knowledge: Ecology and Performance at ICA in London"
description: "For In formation III, I delivered a research-based presentation that explored my curatorial practice in arts and climate change. 'The information that our bodies know and use without conscious thought is a rich form of knowledge that allows for a more fully-embodied connection to the non-human world. Engaging in such forms of ‘embodied knowledge’, creative climate change communicator Worm (Angela Chan), sound artist Robbie Judkins and writer João Florêncio present an evening of performance-lectures that draw on ecology as both a subject and a methodology.'"

"The information that our bodies know and use without conscious thought is a rich form of knowledge that allows for a more fully-embodied connection to the non-human world. Engaging in such forms of ‘embodied knowledge’, creative climate change communicator Worm (Angela Chan), sound artist Robbie Judkins and writer João Florêncio present an evening of performance-lectures that draw on ecology as both a subject and a methodology.

This evening of research-based presentations explores how knowledge may be shared in a non-hierarchical manner, an aim crucial to In formation III. Each presentation will work to move outside of the normative lecture format and to dismantle understandings of human-centered individualism. Advocating for social change, and against restrictive dichotomies between humans and humans, humans and non-humans and non-humans and non-humans, these presentations touch on animal advocacy, mental health, decolonisation, intersectionality, queer theory, performance art history and posthumanism.

Embodied Knowledge: Ecology and Performance is programmed in partnership with curator Ben William Harris and has evolved from research into performance theory and socially engaged ecological art practices."
