description: "I delivered an artist talk as part of Somerset House's Earth Day programming. Contemplating the growing awareness of climate change in contemporary art today, I framed the talk on the question 'How do we participate effectively and sincerely as part of these ecologies?' The talk dissected the challenges in contemporary aesthetics of ecology, the politics of being an environmentally-engaged arts practitioner, and the need to decolonise the arts to forefront environmental justice in our intersections of art and ecology."
