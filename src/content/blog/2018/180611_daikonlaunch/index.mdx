title: "Creativity/Strategy: Navigating Institutions as POC Talk for the daikon* Issue 5 Migration Zine Launch"
description: "For daikon*'s launch of Issue #5 Migration I contributed to the panel discussion Creativity/Strategy: navigating institutions as POC, alongside photographer Bernice Mulenga and curator Amrita Dhallu. Together, we talked 'about working in, and making a difference in, the arts sector; fighting the exploitation of artists through self- and collective care and the prioritisation of wellbeing; and, the importance of supporting other marginalised people in the workplace and in artistic practices. Through these discussions they broke down some of the ways they navigate institutions which don't always have the interests of women of colour at their heart.' daikon* was 'a platform for the writing and art of South-East and East Asian women and non-binary people in Europe.'"
