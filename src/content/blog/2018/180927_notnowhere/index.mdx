Worming Up! was a workshop for QTPOC creative practitioners interested in exploring and confronting the parallels between environmentalism and the arts that are often access barriers. Through conversations, note-making or drawing, the session sought to identify the toxins that impede our creativity and how to implement strategies as arts practitioners. The aim was to think about how we can nurture self-reflective spaces of resilience and empowerment towards alternative ideas of ‘sustainable creative practice’ within our communities and environment.

The workshop explored three areas:
- Environments: What are the effects of climate change on QTPOC? What are the challenges for QTPOC in the arts? Are there parallels in the barriers that stop us from flourishing?
- Actions: What is QTPOC representation like in the environmental and artistic spaces and how is fighting for social justice vital to our daily work as practitioners navigating them?
- Alliances: How can we create networks and spaces of solidarity, trust and empowerment towards our self-critical practices in these areas?
